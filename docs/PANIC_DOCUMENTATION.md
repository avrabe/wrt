# Panic Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

Proper documentation of panic conditions is essential for the WRT project, especially given its use in safety-critical applications. This document outlines the standard approach for documenting potential panics in functions across all crates.

## Why Document Panics?

1. **Safety**: In safety-critical applications, unexpected panics can lead to system failures.
2. **Qualification**: For ASIL-B compliance, all panic conditions must be documented and eventually handled appropriately.
3. **API Clarity**: Users of our libraries need to understand when a function might panic.

## Standard Format

All functions that may panic should include a "Panics" section in their documentation following this format:

```rust
/// # Panics
///
/// This function panics if [describe specific condition], e.g., "the input is empty" or "the index is out of bounds".
/// 
/// Safety impact: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH] - [Brief explanation of the safety implication]
/// 
/// Tracking: WRTQ-XXX (qualification requirement tracking ID)
```

### Safety Impact Levels

- **LOW**: Panic occurs in non-critical path or has built-in recovery mechanisms
- **MEDIUM**: Panic affects component functionality but not overall system safety
- **HIGH**: Panic could lead to system failure in safety-critical scenarios

## Implementation Approach

1. We've added `#![warn(clippy::missing_panics_doc)]` to all crates to identify undocumented panics
2. As we identify panic conditions, we'll document them according to this standard
3. In a later phase, we'll systematically address each panic point according to our final panic handling strategy

## Panic Registry

We'll maintain a central registry of all documented panic points in `docs/panic_registry.csv` with the following columns:

- File path
- Function name
- Line number
- Panic condition
- Safety impact
- Tracking ID
- Resolution status (Todo, In Progress, Resolved)
- Handling strategy (when determined)

## Common Panic Scenarios

Document these scenarios consistently:

1. **Unwrap/Expect Usage**:
   ```rust
   /// # Panics
   /// 
   /// Panics if the underlying operation fails. This typically occurs when [specific conditions].
   /// Safety impact: MEDIUM - [Explain impact]
   /// Tracking: WRTQ-001
   ```

2. **Array/Slice Indexing**:
   ```rust
   /// # Panics
   /// 
   /// Panics if `index` is out of bounds (>= `self.len()`).
   /// Safety impact: MEDIUM - Invalid memory access
   /// Tracking: WRTQ-002
   ```

3. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**:
   ```rust
   /// # Panics
   /// 
   /// Panics in debug mode if arithmetic operation overflows.
   /// Safety impact: HIGH - Potential for memory corruption
   /// Tracking: WRTQ-003
   ```

## Future Direction

This documentation approach is the first step in our safety qualification strategy. In future releases:

1. Critical panics will be replaced with proper error handling
2. Some panics may be retained but will be formally verified to never occur
3. Verification evidence will be included in qualification documentation

## Responsible Teams

- **Safety Team**: Maintains panic registry and safety impact classifications
- **Development Team**: Documents panics as they're identified
- **Qualification Team**: Ensures all panics are addressed in qualification documentation
