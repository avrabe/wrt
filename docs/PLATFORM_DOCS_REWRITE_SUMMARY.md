# Platform Documentation Rewrite Summary

## Overview

I've reviewed and updated the platform documentation to accurately reflect what's actually implemented in the `wrt-platform` crate. The documentation now correctly represents the actual code and capabilities.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Platform Layer Documentation (`platform_layer.rst`)

**Updated to accurately reflect:**
- Core traits: `PageAllocator` and `FutexLike`
- Actually implemented platforms: Linux, macOS, QNX, Zephyr, Tock
- Zero-cost platform abstraction with compile-time paradigms
- Hardware security features abstraction
- Advanced synchronization primitives
- Runtime detection capabilities
- Formal verification annotations
- Side-channel resistance features

**Removed fictional features:**
- Removed made-up API calls that don't exist
- Removed references to unimplemented platforms

### 2. Hardware Security Documentation (`hardware_security.rst`)

**Completely rewritten to match actual implementation:**
- Now accurately describes the `HardwareOptimization` trait
- Shows real abstractions for ARM (PAC, MTE, BTI, TrustZone)
- Shows real abstractions for Intel (CET, MPK)
- Shows real abstractions for RISC-V (PMP, CFI)
- Removed references to SGX, Intel TSX, and other unimplemented features
- Added accurate code examples using the actual API

## What's Actually Implemented

### Core Platform Features
1. **Memory Allocation** (`PageAllocator` trait)
   - Linux: mmap-based with MTE support on ARM64
   - macOS: mmap-based with/without libc
   - QNX: Arena allocator with memory partitioning
   - Zephyr: k_mem_map based
   - Tock: Grant-based allocation
   - Fallback: Static buffer allocation

2. **Synchronization** (`FutexLike` trait)
   - Linux: Native futex
   - macOS: __ulock_wait/wake
   - QNX: SyncCondvar APIs
   - Zephyr: k_futex primitives
   - Tock: IPC or semaphore-based
   - Fallback: Spin-based implementation

3. **Platform Abstraction**
   - Zero-cost compile-time dispatch
   - Four paradigms: Posix, SecurityFirst, RealTime, BareMetal
   - Unified configuration API
   - Auto-selection based on features

4. **Hardware Security**
   - Abstractions for ARM, Intel, and RISC-V security features
   - Compile-time and runtime feature detection
   - Zero-cost when features aren't available
   - Graceful degradation

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Lock-free allocator and data structures
   - Priority inheritance mutex
   - Formal verification annotations
   - Side-channel resistance utilities
   - Runtime capability detection

## Documentation Accuracy

The updated documentation now:
- Shows only real APIs and types that exist in the code
- Uses actual struct and function names from the implementation
- Provides examples that would actually compile (given the right platform)
- Clearly indicates platform-specific features with proper cfg gates
- Matches the module structure and exports in `lib.rs`

## Platform Examples

The platform examples documentation (like `platform_detection.rst`) was already quite accurate and needed minimal changes. It correctly shows:
- The `PlatformDetector` API
- Capability structures
- Platform-specific detection
- Adaptive implementation selection

## Recommendations

1. The QNX platform documentation (`qnx_platform.rst`) is quite detailed and accurate - no major changes needed
2. Platform example files in `docs/source/examples/platform/` are generally good
3. Consider adding more real code examples from the test files
4. Consider documenting the builder patterns more thoroughly
