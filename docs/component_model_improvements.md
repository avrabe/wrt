# WebAssembly Component Model Implementation Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the wrt-format and wrt-decoder crates to better align with the WebAssembly Component Model Binary Format specification.

## 1. Value Section Implementation

The value section encoding and decoding has been fully implemented according to the WebAssembly Component Model specification:

- Complete encoding and decoding of all value types (primitives, composites, references)
- Support for complex value types: records, variants, lists, tuples, flags, enums
- Support for option and result types with proper tag handling
- Support for resource types (own and borrow)
- Proper validation of encoded values

This implementation allows for proper representation and manipulation of all value types defined in the Component Model specification.

## 2. Resource Types and Operations

Enhanced support for resource types has been added:

- Expanded validation for resource type definitions
- Support for different resource representations (Handle32, Handle64, Record, Aggregate)
- Validation for resource operations (new, drop, rep)
- Type checking for resource references in function signatures

## 3. Start Definitions and Value Consumption Tracking

The Start section has been improved with proper value consumption tracking:

- Each value is tracked to ensure it's consumed exactly once
- Values produced by imports, instances, and start functions are tracked
- Values consumed by exports and start function arguments are recorded
- Validation ensures all values are properly consumed, as required by the spec

## 4. Component Name Section

The name section support has been expanded to include all naming features described in the specification:

- Component names
- Sort-specific names
- Import names
- Export names
- Canonical function names
- Type names

The implementation provides proper parsing and generation of name sections for debugging and development purposes.

## 5. Export Metadata Validation

Export name handling has been enhanced to support metadata annotations:

- Resource export flag parsing and validation
- SemVer compatibility string parsing and validation
- Integrity hash for content verification
- Proper encoding and decoding of these annotations

## 6. Enhanced Validation

The validation logic has been significantly expanded:

- Component type validation for all type constructs
- Resource type validation including representation types
- Enhanced export and import validation
- Value type validation with proper recursion for nested types
- Canonical operation validation
- Start function validation with proper type checking

## 7. Testing

New tests have been added to verify the enhanced functionality:

- Component value encoding/decoding tests
- Resource type validation tests
- Name section handling tests

## Next Steps

While substantial improvements have been made, further enhancements could include:

1. Complete implementation of function signature compatibility checking
2. Full validation of resource types in Own and Borrow type contexts
3. Enhanced memory safety checks for resource handling
4. Performance optimizations for value encoding/decoding
5. Formal verification of the binary format implementation

These improvements have significantly enhanced the conformance of the wrt-format and wrt-decoder crates to the WebAssembly Component Model Binary Format specification, providing a more robust foundation for WebAssembly Component Model support in the WRT runtime.
