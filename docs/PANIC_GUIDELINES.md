# Panic Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to documenting and managing panics in our Rust codebase. As a safety-critical project, we need to carefully track where panics can occur, understand their impact, and plan appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Why Document Panics?

Rust's `panic!` mechanism is a form of error handling that abruptly terminates execution when encountering an unrecoverable error. While useful for development, panics in production code can lead to:

1. Service interruptions
2. Data loss
3. Undefined behavior in safety-critical systems
4. Potential security vulnerabilities

## Documentation Format

All functions that can panic must include a dedicated `# Panics` section in their documentation that follows this format:

```rust
/// Function description
///
/// # Panics
/// This function will panic if [specific conditions].
/// Safety impact: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH]
/// Tracking: [WRTQ-ID]
```

### Safety Impact Levels

- **LOW**: Panic is contained within the scope of a single operation and doesn't affect the overall system state.
- **MEDIUM**: Panic may disrupt a subsystem or component but is recoverable at a higher level.
- **HIGH**: Panic could cause system failure, data loss, or compromise safety guarantees.

### Tracking IDs

Each documented panic must have a tracking ID in our issue tracker (WRTQ-XXX format). This allows us to:

1. Track the resolution status of each panic
2. Document the risk assessment
3. Link to any mitigation strategies

## Panic Registry

We maintain a centralized panic registry in `docs/panic_registry.csv` that includes:

- Function name and location
- Panic conditions
- Safety impact assessment
- Tracking ID
- Resolution status
- Handling strategy

The registry is automatically updated by the `scripts/update_panic_registry.py` script, which scans the codebase for documented panics.

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer Result over Panic**: When possible, use `Result<T, E>` instead of panicking functions.
2. **Safe Alternatives**: Provide safe alternatives to panicking functions (e.g., `try_` prefixed versions).
3. **Clear Documentation**: Make panic conditions explicit in documentation.
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Write tests specifically for panic conditions to verify documentation.
5. **Review Panic Points**: Regularly review the panic registry to identify patterns and improvement opportunities.

## Examples

See `docs/panic_documentation_example.rs` for examples of properly documented panics and their safe alternatives.

## Resolving Panics

Options for resolving panic conditions include:

1. **Elimination**: Refactor the code to avoid the panic condition entirely.
2. **Result Conversion**: Convert panicking code to return `Result` or `Option` instead.
3. **Validation**: Add precondition checks to prevent the panic condition.
4. **Documentation**: If the panic must remain, ensure thorough documentation and risk assessment.
5. **Tests**: Add tests that verify the panic occurs under the documented conditions.
