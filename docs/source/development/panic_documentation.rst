Panic Documentation Guidelines
================================

Overview
--------

This document outlines our approach to documenting and managing panics in the WRT project Rust codebase. As a safety-critical project, we need to carefully track where panics can occur, understand their impact, and plan appropriate mitigation strategies.

Why Document Panics?
-------------------

Rust's ``panic!`` mechanism is a form of error handling that abruptly terminates execution when encountering an unrecoverable error. While useful for development, panics in production code can lead to:

1. **Safety**: In safety-critical applications, unexpected panics can lead to system failures.
2. **Qualification**: For ASIL-B compliance, all panic conditions must be documented and eventually handled appropriately.
3. **API Clarity**: Users of our libraries need to understand when a function might panic.
4. **Service Interruptions**: Unhandled panics can cause system downtime.
5. **Data Loss**: Panics can interrupt operations, potentially leading to data corruption.
6. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Improper error handling can create exploitable weaknesses.

Documentation Format
------------------

All functions that may panic should include a "Panics" section in their documentation following this format:

.. code-block:: rust

    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// This function panics if [describe specific condition], e.g., "the input is empty" or "the index is out of bounds".
    /// 
    /// Safety impact: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH] - [Brief explanation of the safety implication]
    /// 
    /// Tracking: WRTQ-XXX (qualification requirement tracking ID).

Safety Impact Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **LOW**: Panic is contained within the scope of a single operation and doesn't affect the overall system state.
- **MEDIUM**: Panic affects component functionality but not overall system safety.
- **HIGH**: Panic could cause system failure, data loss, or compromise safety guarantees.

Tracking IDs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Each documented panic must have a tracking ID in our issue tracker (WRTQ-XXX format). This allows us to:

1. Track the resolution status of each panic
2. Document the risk assessment
3. Link to any mitigation strategies

Implementation Approach
----------------------

1. We've added ``#![warn(clippy::missing_panics_doc)]`` to all crates to identify undocumented panics
2. As we identify panic conditions, we'll document them according to this standard
3. In a later phase, we'll systematically address each panic point according to our final panic handling strategy

Panic Registry
-------------

We maintain panic documentation in two formats:

1. A CSV file at ``docs/source/development/panic_registry.csv`` that is easy to read and maintain
2. A structured RST file using sphinx-needs at ``docs/source/development/panic_registry.rst`` for qualification documentation

The registry is automatically updated by the ``xtask update-panic-registry`` command, which scans the codebase for documented panics and updates both formats.

CSV Registry
~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSV registry includes the following information:

.. csv-table:: Panic Registry
   :file: panic_registry.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20, 15, 5, 20, 5, 10, 10, 15

Sphinx-Needs Registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For qualification purposes, all panic points are also available in a structured format using sphinx-needs in the :doc:`panic_registry` document. This allows:

- Cross-referencing of panic points in documentation
- Filtering and searching by safety impact level
- Integration with qualification traceability matrices
- Status tracking and reporting

Common Panic Scenarios
---------------------

Document these scenarios consistently:

1. **Unwrap/Expect Usage**:

   .. code-block:: rust

      /// # Panics
      /// 
      /// Panics if the underlying operation fails. This typically occurs when [specific conditions].
      /// Safety impact: MEDIUM - [Explain impact]
      /// Tracking: WRTQ-001

2. **Array/Slice Indexing**:

   .. code-block:: rust

      /// # Panics
      /// 
      /// Panics if `index` is out of bounds (>= `self.len()`).
      /// Safety impact: MEDIUM - Invalid memory access
      /// Tracking: WRTQ-002

3. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**:

   .. code-block:: rust

      /// # Panics
      /// 
      /// Panics in debug mode if arithmetic operation overflows.
      /// Safety impact: HIGH - Potential for memory corruption
      /// Tracking: WRTQ-003

Best Practices
-------------

1. **Prefer Result over Panic**: When possible, use ``Result<T, E>`` instead of panicking functions.
2. **Safe Alternatives**: Provide safe alternatives to panicking functions (e.g., ``try_`` prefixed versions).
3. **Clear Documentation**: Make panic conditions explicit in documentation.
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Write tests specifically for panic conditions to verify documentation.
5. **Review Panic Points**: Regularly review the panic registry to identify patterns and improvement opportunities.

Examples
-------

See the :ref:`panic-documentation-example` for examples of properly documented panics and their safe alternatives.

Resolving Panics
---------------

Options for resolving panic conditions include:

1. **Elimination**: Refactor the code to avoid the panic condition entirely.
2. **Result Conversion**: Convert panicking code to return ``Result`` or ``Option`` instead.
3. **Validation**: Add precondition checks to prevent the panic condition.
4. **Documentation**: If the panic must remain, ensure thorough documentation and risk assessment.
5. **Tests**: Add tests that verify the panic occurs under the documented conditions.

Future Direction
--------------

This documentation approach is the first step in our safety qualification strategy. In future releases:

1. Critical panics will be replaced with proper error handling
2. Some panics may be retained but will be formally verified to never occur
3. Verification evidence will be included in qualification documentation

Responsible Teams
---------------

- **Safety Team**: Maintains panic registry and safety impact classifications
- **Development Team**: Documents panics as they're identified
- **Qualification Team**: Ensures all panics are addressed in qualification documentation
