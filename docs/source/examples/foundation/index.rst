   "The foundation is the most important part of any building."
   
   -- Unknown Architect (but definitely not a software one)

The ``wrt-foundation`` crate is where the magic happens. It provides the core building blocks that make WRT safe, fast, and suitable for embedded systems. No heap allocations, no panics, just rock-solid primitives you can trust.

What's in the Foundation? üèóÔ∏è
-----------------------------

Think of ``wrt-foundation`` as your Swiss Army knife for safety-critical WebAssembly:

- **Bounded Collections**: Fixed-size collections that never allocate
- **Safe Memory**: Bounds-checked slices and memory adapters
- **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free primitives for concurrent code
- **No-std Utilities**: HashMap and friends without the standard library
- **Resource Management**: Handle tables and lifecycle tracking

Why These Matter üéØ
-------------------

**For Embedded Systems:**
   When you're running on a microcontroller with 64KB of RAM, you can't afford heap allocations or unbounded growth. Every byte counts.

**For Safety-Critical Code:**
   In automotive or aerospace applications, a panic is not an option. These primitives are designed to fail gracefully and predictably.

**For Performance:**
   Zero-cost abstractions aren't just a Rust thing - they're a WRT thing too. These primitives compile down to efficient machine code.

     - Zero overhead

Getting Started üöÄ
------------------

Add ``wrt-foundation`` to your ``Cargo.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [dependencies]
   wrt-foundation = "0.1"

Then import the prelude:

.. code-block:: rust

   use wrt_foundation::prelude::*;

That's it! You're ready to build bulletproof WebAssembly modules.

.. admonition:: Design Philosophy
   :class: note

   Every type in ``wrt-foundation`` follows these principles:
   
   1. **No Hidden Allocations**: What you see is what you get
   2. **Explicit Error Handling**: No surprises, no panics
   3. **Const-Friendly**: Use them in const contexts where possible
   4. **Zero-Cost**: Abstractions compile away completely
   5. **Verified Safe**: Formally verified or extensively tested
