   The testing and verification architecture includes:
   
   1. WAST test runner for specification conformance
   2. Safety tests for verifying safety mechanisms
   3. Fuzzing infrastructure for identifying edge cases
   4. Code coverage measurement
   5. Quality assurance processes
   6. Component model testing
   7. Memory safety verification tests

.. impl:: WAST Test Runner
   :id: IMPL_009
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_022, REQ_WASM_001
   
   The WAST test runner tool is a specialized binary for executing WebAssembly specification tests:
   
   1. Parses and executes WAST test files
   2. Validates interpreter behavior against the WebAssembly specification
   3. Tracks test results for conformance reporting
   4. Supports blacklisting of tests that are known to fail

.. impl:: Safety Testing
   :id: IMPL_SAFETY_TESTING_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: SPEC_010, REQ_SAFETY_002, REQ_QA_001, REQ_QA_003, IMPL_SAFETY_TEST_001, IMPL_FUZZ_001, IMPL_TEST_COV_001
   
   Safety testing includes:
   
   1. Comprehensive test suite for safety mechanisms
   2. Fuzzing infrastructure for finding edge cases
   3. Coverage measurement for quality assurance
   4. Automated test execution in CI pipeline
   5. Memory safety tests
   6. Resource exhaustion tests
   7. Component model validation tests
