   The safety architecture consists of:
   
   1. Memory safety mechanisms (see :doc:`safe_memory` and :doc:`memory_model`)
   2. Resource limitation controls (see :doc:`resource_management`)
   3. Error handling strategies
   4. Verification systems
   5. Code quality assurance processes
   6. Thread safety implementation
   7. Execution bounding mechanisms (see :doc:`core_runtime`)

.. impl:: Memory Safety Implementations
   :id: IMPL_MEMORY_SAFETY_001
   :status: implemented

   Memory safety is ensured through:
   
   1. Comprehensive bounds checking in all memory operations
   2. Safe memory adapters for interfacing with WebAssembly memory
   3. Validation of memory access operations
   4. SafeSlice implementation for memory-safe views (see :doc:`safe_memory`)
   5. Thread-safe memory access with atomic counters and locks
   6. Memory integrity verification
   7. Memory operation hooks for custom memory management

   Resource management safety features include:
   
   1. Explicit resource limits for memory, stack, and execution
   2. Bounded collections with capacity limits
   3. Fuel-based execution limiting
   4. Resource exhaustion handling
   5. Resource reference counting
