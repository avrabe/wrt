The Component Model subsystem implements the WebAssembly Component Model Preview 2 specification with enhanced support for value types and resources.

   The Component Model implementation provides:
   
   1. Component instantiation and linking
   2. Interface type conversion with type compatibility checking
   3. Resource type management and lifecycle tracking
   4. Host function binding and integration
   5. Binary format parsing and validation
   6. Component instance management
   7. Value section encoding/decoding
   8. Name section handling for debugging
   9. Export and import handling
   10. Execution context management

.. impl:: Component Implementation

   :status: implemented
   :links: SPEC_003, REQ_014, REQ_019, REQ_WASM_001
   
   The ``Component`` struct represents a WebAssembly component:
   
   1. Parses component binary format
   2. Manages component instances
   3. Handles interface binding
   4. Orchestrates resource lifetime
   5. Tracks value consumption for proper validation
   
   Key methods include:
   - ``load_from_binary(bytes)`` - Loads a component binary
   - ``instantiate(engine, imports)`` - Creates a new component instance
   - ``link(other_component)`` - Links two components together

.. impl:: Value Types and Encoding
   :id: IMPL_012
   :status: implemented
   :links: SPEC_003, REQ_014, REQ_019, REQ_021
   
   The value types implementation provides:
   
   1. Complete encoding and decoding of all value types
   2. Support for complex types (records, variants, lists, tuples, flags, enums)
   3. Support for option and result types with proper tag handling
   4. Type validation for encoded values
   5. Efficient serialization and deserialization
   6. Conversion strategies for different type representations
   7. Built-in support for common value types
   
   This implementation allows for proper representation and manipulation of all value types defined in the Component Model specification.

.. impl:: Interface Type Handling
   :id: IMPL_006
   :status: implemented
   :links: SPEC_003, REQ_014, REQ_019
   
   Interface types are managed through:
   
   1. Type adapters for each interface type
   2. Conversion between host and component types
   3. Validation of type compatibility
   4. Strategies for different conversion approaches
   
   The implementation handles interface types including records, variants, enums, flags, and resources with proper type conversion and validation.
