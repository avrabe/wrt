The safe memory architecture provides memory safety abstractions designed for functional safety, implementing verification mechanisms to detect memory corruption.

   The safe memory architecture consists of:
   
   1. SafeSlice abstraction with integrity verification
   2. Memory providers for different environments (std, no_std)
   3. Data integrity verification with checksums
   4. Configurable verification levels for performance/safety balance
   5. Access tracking for memory analysis
   6. Thread-safe operations

   :status: implemented

   The safe memory system is implemented through:
   
   1. The ``SafeSlice`` type providing a memory-safe view with integrity checks
   2. The ``MemoryProvider`` trait for different memory backends
   3. The ``MemorySafety`` trait for safety operations
   4. Memory providers for different environments:
      - ``StdMemoryProvider`` for standard environments
      - ``NoStdMemoryProvider`` for no_std environments
   
   Key features include:
   - Checksums for data integrity verification
   - Configurable verification levels (None, Basic, Sampling, Full)
   - Memory access logging and statistics
   - Thread-safe operations with atomic counters
   - Access verification for bounds checking
   - Support for slicing with safety guarantees
