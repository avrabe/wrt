Memory Subsystem Architecture
===========================

.. note::
   This section describes the *original* memory subsystem based on ``Vec<u8>``. It will be updated to reflect the new platform-abstracted ``LinearMemory<P: PageAllocator>`` design detailed in the memory rework plan.

The memory subsystem provides a consolidated implementation across the WRT ecosystem with enhanced safety features.

   The original memory subsystem architecture consisted of:
   
   1. Centralized memory implementation in ``wrt-runtime::Memory`` (using ``Vec<u8>``)
   2. Memory operations in ``wrt-instructions::memory_ops``
   3. Consistent memory access across core and component models
   4. Thread-safe memory metrics for profiling and optimization
   5. Comprehensive bounds checking for safety
   6. Performance tracking with access counts and peak usage monitoring
   7. Support for both standard and no-std environments
   8. Memory hooks for custom memory management integration

   The original ``Memory`` struct in ``wrt-runtime`` provided a consolidated implementation that:
   
   1. Handled memory allocations and resizing (via ``Vec<u8>``)
   2. Enforced memory access boundaries
   3. Provided safe read/write operations
   4. Tracked memory access metrics
   5. Monitored peak memory usage
   6. Supported thread-safe operations
   7. Provided debug name capabilities
   8. Supported pre and post grow hooks
   9. Performed memory integrity verification
   10. Implemented thread-safe operations with environment-specific synchronization
   
   Key methods include:
   - ``grow(pages)`` - Grows memory by the specified number of pages
   - ``size()`` - Returns the current memory size in pages
   - ``read/write(addr, data)`` - Safely reads/writes memory with bounds checking
   - ``peak_memory()`` - Returns the peak memory usage during execution
   - ``access_count()`` - Returns the number of memory accesses for profiling
   - ``get_safe_slice()`` - Provides a memory-safe view of a memory region
   - ``verify_integrity()`` - Verifies memory integrity
   - ``with_pre_grow_hook/with_post_grow_hook`` - Registers hooks for memory growth events

.. impl:: Memory Operations (Original)
   :id: IMPL_011

   :links: SPEC_007, REQ_018, REQ_023, REQ_MEM_SAFETY_001, REQ_MEM_SAFETY_003, IMPL_WASM_MEM_001
   
   The ``memory_ops`` module in ``wrt-instructions`` provided:
   
   1. Standardized memory access operations
   2. Implementation of WebAssembly memory instructions
   3. Bounds and alignment checking
   4. Efficient memory load/store operations
   5. Memory fill, copy, and initialization operations
   
   Key operations include:
   - ``MemoryLoad`` - Loads values from memory with proper type conversion
   - ``MemoryStore`` - Stores values to memory with proper type conversion
   - ``MemorySize`` - Returns the current memory size
   - ``MemoryGrow`` - Expands the memory by a specified number of pages
   - ``MemoryFill`` - Fills a memory region with a specified value
   - ``MemoryCopy`` - Copies data between memory regions
   - ``MemoryInit`` - Initializes memory from data segments


New Memory Model (Overview)
---------------------------

The memory rework replaces the ``Vec<u8>`` backend with a ``LinearMemory<P: PageAllocator>`` structure.

*   ``LinearMemory``: Manages the WebAssembly linear memory abstraction.
*   ``PageAllocator``: A trait provided by the :doc:`platform_layer` responsible for:
    *   Allocating page-aligned memory (typically 64KiB Wasm pages).
    *   Handling memory growth requests.
    *   Applying memory protection (read/write/execute).
    *   Optionally mapping memory with MTE tags (if requested via :doc:`hardening` features and supported by the platform).

This allows the core runtime memory logic to be independent of the underlying OS memory management details.
