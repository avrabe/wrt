The intercept system provides a flexible mechanism for intercepting function calls between components and between components and the host.

   The intercept system architecture consists of:
   
   1. Core interception framework with strategy pattern
   2. Flexible interception points for component interactions
   3. Built-in strategies for common use cases
   4. Canonical ABI integration for type-safe interception
   5. Memory strategy selection for performance and safety
   6. Security controls for proper isolation

   :id: IMPL_INTERCEPT_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: SPEC_011, REQ_014, REQ_020
   
   The intercept system is implemented through:
   
   1. The ``LinkInterceptorStrategy`` trait defining interception points
   2. The ``LinkInterceptor`` class coordinating strategy application
   3. Interception result processing with detailed modification capabilities
   4. Built-in strategies for common use cases:
      - Logging strategy for debugging and tracing
      - Firewall strategy for security enforcement
      - Statistics strategy for performance monitoring
   
   Key features include:
   - Function call interception before and after execution
   - Optional function bypass for security and mocking
   - Canonical ABI interception for type-safe data manipulation
   - Resource operation interception
   - Memory strategy selection for performance optimization
   - Component start function interception
