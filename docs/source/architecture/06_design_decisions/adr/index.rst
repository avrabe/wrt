========================================
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
========================================

.. warning::
   **Development Status**: Individual ADR documents are being created as architectural 
   decisions are made during development. This section will expand over time.

Overview
========

This section contains detailed Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for PulseEngine. 
Each ADR documents a specific architectural decision with full context, alternatives, 
and consequences.

ADR Format
==========

Each ADR follows a standard template:

- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: The chosen approach
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes

Active ADRs
===========

Core Architecture

   adr-001-multi-environment-support
   adr-002-safety-memory-management
   adr-003-component-model-architecture
   adr-004-platform-abstraction

.. note::
   **Status Legend**:
   
   - ‚úÖ **Accepted**: Decision implemented and stable
   - üöß **Under Review**: Decision being evaluated
   - üìã **Proposed**: Decision suggested but not yet reviewed
   - ‚ùå **Rejected**: Decision considered but not adopted
   - üîÑ **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR

Planned ADRs
============

The following ADRs are planned for future architectural decisions:

- **ADR-005**: WebAssembly instruction execution strategy
- **ADR-006**: Integration testing approach  
- **ADR-007**: Performance optimization strategy
- **ADR-008**: Security boundary implementation
- **ADR-009**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **ADR-010**: Logging and observability strategy

ADR Process
===========

Creating a New ADR
------------------

1. **Identify the Decision**: Significant architectural choice requiring documentation
2. **Research Options**: Gather information about alternatives
3. **Draft ADR**: Use the template to document the decision
4. **Review Process**: Technical review by architecture team
5. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or request modifications
6. **Implementation**: Update architecture to reflect decision

ADR Template
============

Use this template for new ADRs:

.. code-block:: rst

   =====================================
   ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]
   =====================================

   :Date: YYYY-MM-DD
   :Status: [Proposed|Accepted|Rejected|Superseded]
   :Deciders: [List of decision makers]
   :Technical Story: [Optional: link to issue/story]

   Context and Problem Statement
   =============================

   [Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using 
   two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form 
   of a question.]

   Decision Drivers
   ================

   * [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, ...]
   * [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, ...]
   * ... [numbers of drivers can vary]

   Considered Options
   ==================

   * [option 1]
   * [option 2]
   * [option 3]
   * ... [numbers of options can vary]

   Decision Outcome
   ================

   Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, 
   which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | 
   ... | comes out best (see below)].

   Positive Consequences
   ---------------------

   * [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, ...]
   * ...

   Negative Consequences
   --------------------

   * [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, ...]
   * ...

   Pros and Cons of the Options
   =============================

   [option 1]
   -----------

   [example | description | pointer to more information | ...]

   * Good, because [argument a]
   * Good, because [argument b]
   * Bad, because [argument c]
   * ...

   [option 2]
   -----------

   [example | description | pointer to more information | ...]

   * Good, because [argument a]
   * Good, because [argument b]
   * Bad, because [argument c]
   * ...

   [option 3]
   -----------

   [example | description | pointer to more information | ...]

   * Good, because [argument a]
   * Good, because [argument b]
   * Bad, because [argument c]
   * ...

   Links
   =====

   * [Link type] [Link to ADR] <!-- example: Refined by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md) -->
   * ... <!-- numbers of links can vary -->

Review Guidelines
=================

When reviewing ADRs, consider:

**Technical Aspects**:
- Is the problem clearly stated?
- Are all reasonable alternatives considered?
- Is the decision well-justified?
- Are consequences (positive and negative) identified?

**Process Aspects**:
- Does the ADR follow the template?
- Are the right stakeholders involved?
- Is the ADR linked to relevant requirements or issues?

**Documentation Quality**:
- Is the ADR clear and understandable?
- Would someone new to the project understand the context?
- Are all necessary details included?

Maintenance
===========

ADRs are living documents:

- **Updates**: ADRs may be updated if new information emerges
- **Status Changes**: ADR status reflects current applicability
- **Linking**: New ADRs should reference related existing ADRs
- **Archival**: Superseded ADRs are kept for historical context

Process Notes
=============

.. note::
   **ASPICE Mapping**: ADRs support ASPICE SWE.2.BP6 (Evaluate architectural 
   design alternatives) by providing detailed documentation of architectural 
   decisions and their rationale.

   **Tool Integration**: ADRs may be generated from or linked to design tools, 
   issue trackers, and requirements management systems.
