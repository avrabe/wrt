The resource management subsystem handles WebAssembly Component Model resources with proper lifetime management.

   The resource management architecture consists of:
   
   1. Resource type definitions and representations
   2. Resource tables for tracking live resources
   3. Reference counting and lifecycle management
   4. Resource operation handlers (new, drop, rep, transform)
   5. Memory-based resource strategies with buffer pooling
   6. Resource handle and ID management
   7. Host callbacks for resource lifecycle events
   8. Resource validation and security checks

.. _resource-capacity-system:

.. spec:: Resource Capacity System
   :id: SPEC_CAP_001
   :links: REQ_RESOURCE_001, REQ_RESOURCE_002, REQ_RESOURCE_003
   
   The resource capacity system defines:
   
   1. Maximum memory allocation limits
   2. Stack size constraints
   3. Resource table capacity limits
   4. Component instance count limitations
   5. Fuel-based execution limits
   6. Resource exhaustion handling strategies

.. impl:: Resource Type Handling
   :id: IMPL_010
   :status: implemented
   :links: SPEC_003, SPEC_008, REQ_014, REQ_019, REQ_RESOURCE_001, IMPL_RESOURCE_LIMITS_001
   
   Resource types are implemented through:
   
   1. Reference counting for resource instances
   2. Resource tables for tracking live resources
   3. Host callbacks for resource lifecycle events
   4. Resource dropping semantics with proper cleanup
   5. Support for different resource representations (Handle32, Handle64, Record, Aggregate)
   6. Validation for resource operations (new, drop, rep, transform)
   7. Resource strategy pattern for extensible resource implementation
   8. Memory buffer pooling for efficient resource memory management
   
   Key components:
   - ``Resource`` struct - Represents a component model resource
   - ``ResourceType`` - Type information for resources
   - ``ResourceManager`` - Manages resource instances and lifecycles
   - ``ResourceOperation`` - Represents operations on resources
   - ``ResourceStrategy`` - Strategy interface for resource implementation
   - ``MemoryStrategy`` - Memory-based resource strategy
   - ``BufferPool`` - Memory buffer pooling for resources
   - Resource lifetime management functions
