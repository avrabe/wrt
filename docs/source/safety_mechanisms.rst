Memory Safety Mechanisms
------------------------

.. safety:: Memory Safety Boundaries Rev3
   :id: SAFETY_MEM_003
   :status: active
   :links: REQ_MEM_SAFETY_001, IMPL_BOUNDS_001, IMPL_BOUNDS_CHECK_001, T_MEM_BOUNDS_001
   
   The runtime implements comprehensive memory boundary protection with the following features:
   
   * SafeSlice implementation with bounds checking for all memory operations
   * Integer overflow detection in offset calculations
   * Memory adapter interfaces that enforce strict boundaries
   * Validation of memory regions before access operations

Resource Management Safety
--------------------------

.. safety:: Resource Limitation Safety Rev3
   :id: SAFETY_RESOURCE_003
   :status: active
   :links: REQ_RESOURCE_001, IMPL_LIMITS_001, T_RESOURCE_001
   
   The runtime implements resource limitation safety with the following mechanisms:
   
   * Configurable memory page limits with strict enforcement
   * Stack depth tracking and bounds checking
   * Call depth limitation to prevent stack overflow
   * Fuel-based execution time limits
   * Resource usage tracking and reporting

Recovery Mechanisms
-------------------

.. safety:: Error Recovery Strategy Rev3
   :id: SAFETY_RECOVERY_003
   :status: active
   :links: REQ_ERROR_004, IMPL_RECOVERY_001
   
   The runtime implements error recovery with the following approaches:
   
   * Checkpoint-based state restoration
   * Graceful degradation modes
   * Component isolation to prevent error propagation
   * Detailed error logging and diagnostic information
   * Safe fallback strategies for critical operations

WebAssembly Import Safety
-------------------------

.. safety:: WebAssembly Import Function Safety Rev3
   :id: SAFETY_IMPORTS_003
   :status: active
   :links: REQ_WASM_002, IMPL_IMPORT_SAFETY_001
   
   The runtime implements import function safety with:
   
   * Parameter validation and sanitization
   * Type checking between WebAssembly and host types
   * Memory access validation for imported memory functions
   * Resource tracking for imported functions
   * Error handling for invalid inputs

Code Safety Mechanisms
----------------------

.. safety:: Unsafe Code Protection Rev3
   :id: SAFETY_UNSAFE_003
   :status: active
   :links: REQ_CODE_QUALITY_002, IMPL_CODE_REVIEW_001
   
   The runtime implements unsafe code protection with:
   
   * Strict code reviews for all unsafe blocks
   * Documentation of invariants and safety guarantees
   * Comprehensive test coverage for unsafe regions
   * Abstraction of unsafe code behind safe interfaces
   * Verification of unsafe code preconditions and postconditions

Testing Safety Mechanisms
-------------------------

.. safety:: Fuzzing Infrastructure
   :id: SAFETY_FUZZ_001
   :status: active
   :links: REQ_QA_003, IMPL_FUZZ_001, T_FUZZ_001
   
   The runtime implements fuzzing-based safety verification with:
   
   * Continuous fuzzing of critical interfaces
   * Memory operation fuzzing for boundary condition detection
   * Input validation fuzzing for import functions
   * Fault injection testing for error handling paths
   * Edge case discovery through structured fuzzing strategies
