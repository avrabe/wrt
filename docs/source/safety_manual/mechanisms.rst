This document consolidates all safety mechanisms implemented in PulseEngine (WRT Edition) to satisfy safety requirements and protect against systematic and random faults.

.. warning::
   **Implementation Note**: Safety mechanisms must be configured according to the 
   target ASIL level. See :doc:`configuration` for ASIL-specific configuration guidance.

Overview
========

Mechanism Categories
--------------------

Safety mechanisms are organized by the fault types they address:

1. **Memory Safety Mechanisms** - Prevent memory corruption and access violations
2. **Control Flow Integrity** - Protect execution flow from hijacking
3. **Resource Protection** - Prevent resource exhaustion and starvation  
4. **Temporal Safety** - Ensure timing constraints and prevent lockups
5. **Data Integrity** - Protect data from corruption and tampering
6. **Fault Detection** - Identify and report fault conditions
7. **Error Recovery** - Restore safe operation after faults

Mechanism Attributes
--------------------

Each mechanism includes:

- **ID**: Unique identifier (SAFETY_CATEGORY_NNN)
- **Detection**: Fault detection capability and coverage
- **Reaction**: Response to detected faults
- **ASIL**: Required for ASIL levels (A, B, C, D)
- **Diagnostic Coverage**: Percentage of faults detected
