Safety Case Overview
====================

Safety Claim
------------

**Top-Level Safety Claim**: WRT foundation components are sufficiently safe for deployment in ASIL-A automotive applications when configured and integrated according to this safety case.

Scope of Safety Case
--------------------

This safety case covers:

- WRT foundation memory management system
- Capability-based allocation mechanisms
- Runtime safety monitoring system

- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

Exclusions:

      pub fn create_with_context<const N: usize>(
          context: &MemoryCapabilityContext,
          crate_id: CrateId,
      ) -> Result<NoStdProvider<N>> {
          // Verify allocation capability  
          let operation = MemoryOperation::Allocate { size: N };
          let verification_result = context.verify_operation(crate_id, &operation);
          
          // Record safety monitoring events
          with_safety_monitor(|monitor| {
              match &verification_result {
                  Ok(_) => monitor.record_allocation(N),
                  Err(_) => {
                      monitor.record_allocation_failure(N);
                      monitor.record_capability_violation(crate_id);
                  }
              }
          });
          
          verification_result?;
          Ok(NoStdProvider::<N>::default())
      }

      // Thread-safe safety monitoring
      pub fn with_safety_monitor<F, R>(f: F) -> R 
      where F: FnOnce(&mut SafetyMonitor) -> R {
          // Simple spinlock for thread safety
          while unsafe { core::ptr::read_volatile(&raw const MONITOR_LOCK) } {
              core::hint::spin_loop();
          }
          
          unsafe {
              core::ptr::write_volatile(&raw mut MONITOR_LOCK, true);
              let result = f(&mut *core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(SAFETY_MONITOR));
              core::ptr::write_volatile(&raw mut MONITOR_LOCK, false);

          // Calculate failure rates
          let failure_rate = (self.allocation_monitor.failed_allocations * 100) / total;
          let violation_rate = (self.allocation_monitor.budget_violations * 100) / total;
          let capability_rate = (self.capability_monitor.access_violations * 100) / total;
          
          // Start with perfect score and deduct for failures
          let mut score = 100u8;
          score = score.saturating_sub((failure_rate as u8).min(40));
          score = score.saturating_sub((violation_rate as u8).min(30));
          score = score.saturating_sub((capability_rate as u8).min(30));
          
          // Fatal errors immediately drop to critical
          if self.error_monitor.fatal_errors > 0 {
              score = score.min(50);
