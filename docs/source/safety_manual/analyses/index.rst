This section contains safety analyses performed on PulseEngine as part of the safety assessment process according to ISO 26262 and IEC 61508.

.. warning::
   **Analysis Status**: These analyses are based on the current design and 
   implementation. They must be updated as the system evolves.

Overview
========

Purpose of Safety Analyses
--------------------------

Safety analyses are systematic examinations of the system to:

1. **Identify Hazards** - Find potential sources of harm
2. **Assess Risks** - Evaluate likelihood and severity 
3. **Verify Mechanisms** - Confirm safety mechanisms are adequate
4. **Guide Design** - Inform architectural decisions
5. **Provide Evidence** - Support safety case arguments

Analysis Types
--------------

The following analyses have been performed:

- **Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA)** - Identifies hazards and determines ASIL levels
- **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)** - Systematic analysis of failure modes
- **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)** - Top-down analysis of failure combinations
- **Formal Verification** - Mathematical proofs of safety properties
- **Common Cause Failure Analysis** - Identifies dependent failures
- **Software Safety Analysis** - Software-specific hazard analysis

Analysis Process
================

Methodology
-----------

All analyses follow a systematic process:

1. **Scope Definition** - Define boundaries and assumptions
2. **Systematic Examination** - Apply analysis technique
3. **Risk Evaluation** - Assess severity and likelihood
4. **Mitigation Identification** - Define safety mechanisms
5. **Residual Risk Assessment** - Evaluate remaining risk
6. **Documentation** - Record results and decisions

Review and Update
-----------------

Analyses are reviewed and updated:

- At major design changes
- After field issue reports
- During periodic safety reviews
- Before safety assessment

Tools and Techniques
--------------------

The following tools support our analyses:

- **KANI** - Formal verification framework
- **Fault injection** - Runtime failure simulation
- **Static analysis** - Code-level verification
- **Model checking** - State space exploration

Analysis Results Summary
========================

Key Findings
------------

Across all analyses, the key findings are:

1. **Memory Safety Critical** - Memory corruption is highest risk
2. **Bounded Resources Essential** - Resource exhaustion must be prevented
3. **Deterministic Execution Required** - Non-determinism introduces hazards
4. **Isolation Mechanisms Crucial** - Module isolation prevents propagation
5. **Monitoring Necessary** - Runtime monitoring detects latent faults

Next Steps
==========

After reviewing analyses:

1. Check :doc:`../mechanisms` for mitigation implementation
2. Verify with :doc:`../verification` procedures
3. Review :doc:`../safety_case` for overall argument
4. Ensure :doc:`../assumptions` align with findings
