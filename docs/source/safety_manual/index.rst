This Safety Manual provides comprehensive safety documentation for PulseEngine (WRT Edition) as a Safety Element out of Context (SEooC) according to ISO 26262, IEC 61508, and IEC 62304 standards.

.. warning::
   **Certification Status**: PulseEngine is currently NOT certified to any safety standard.
   This manual documents the safety architecture and preparation for future certification efforts.

Introduction
============

Purpose
-------

This Safety Manual serves as the single source of truth for all safety-related aspects of PulseEngine. It consolidates previously scattered safety documentation into a unified structure following ISO 26262 Part 10 (SEooC) guidelines.

Scope
-----

The manual covers:

- Safety assumptions and constraints for SEooC development
- Comprehensive safety requirements specification
- Safety mechanisms and their implementation
- Verification and validation strategies
- Configuration management for safety-critical deployments
- Integration guidance for system integrators

Document Structure
------------------

This manual is organized according to ISO 26262 SEooC requirements:

1. **Assumptions of Use** - Documented constraints and operational assumptions
2. **Safety Requirements** - Complete specification of safety requirements
3. **Safety Mechanisms** - Description of implemented safety features
4. **Safety Analyses** - Hazard analysis, FMEA, and formal verification
5. **Verification & Validation** - Test strategies and evidence
6. **Configuration Management** - Safety-critical configuration control
7. **Integration Guidance** - Instructions for safe integration

Safety Element out of Context (SEooC) Approach
==============================================

Definition
----------

PulseEngine is developed as a Safety Element out of Context (SEooC), meaning it is not developed for a specific automotive item or application. This approach requires:

- Clear documentation of assumptions
- Comprehensive safety requirements
- Flexible safety mechanisms
- Detailed integration guidance

Key Assumptions
---------------

As an SEooC, PulseEngine makes the following key assumptions:

1. **Operational Environment**
   
   - Deployment in safety-critical systems up to ASIL-D
   - Resource-constrained embedded environments
   - Real-time operational requirements
   - Deterministic execution requirements

2. **Integration Context**
   
   - Integration by qualified safety engineers
   - Availability of system-level safety mechanisms
   - Proper configuration according to safety requirements
   - Verification of assumptions at system level

3. **Usage Constraints**
   
   - No dynamic memory allocation after initialization
   - Bounded execution time requirements
   - Limited stack depth usage
   - Deterministic resource consumption

Safety Standards Compliance
===========================

Target Standards
----------------

This manual addresses requirements from:

- **ISO 26262:2018** - Road vehicles functional safety (ASIL-D)
- **IEC 61508:2010** - Functional safety of E/E/PE systems (SIL 3)
- **IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015** - Medical device software (Class C)

.. note::
   While PulseEngine architecture supports these standards, actual certification 
   requires completion of the core execution engine and formal assessment.

Compliance Strategy
-------------------

The safety manual follows a structured approach:

1. **Requirements Traceability** - All safety requirements traced to standards
2. **Safety Mechanisms** - Implemented according to ASIL-D guidelines
3. **Verification Evidence** - Comprehensive test coverage and formal proofs
4. **Documentation** - Complete lifecycle documentation

ASIL-A Certification Ready
==========================

.. note::
   **WRT Foundation components are now ready for ASIL-A certification** with comprehensive
   safety mechanisms, formal verification, and production monitoring systems.

Quick Start for ASIL-A
----------------------

For immediate ASIL-A deployment:

1. **Implementation Guide**: :doc:`asil_a_implementation_guide` - Complete implementation instructions
2. **Safety Case**: :doc:`asil_a_safety_case` - Formal safety argument and evidence
3. **Certification**: :doc:`asil_a_certification_checklist` - Step-by-step certification guide

Key ASIL-A Features:

✅ **83% KANI Formal Verification** - Mathematical proofs of safety properties
✅ **Runtime Safety Monitoring** - Real-time health scoring and violation detection
✅ **Capability-Based Memory Safety** - Zero unsafe allocations with budget enforcement
✅ **Production Telemetry** - Structured safety event logging for operational monitoring

Using This Manual
=================

For Safety Engineers
--------------------

- Start with :doc:`asil_a_implementation_guide` for ASIL-A deployment
- Review :doc:`assumptions` before integration
- Verify all :doc:`requirements` are met in your system
- Configure :doc:`mechanisms` according to your ASIL level
- Follow :doc:`integration` guidelines

For Developers
--------------

- Understand :doc:`requirements` before implementation
- Implement according to :doc:`implementations`
- Verify changes with :doc:`verification` procedures
- Maintain :doc:`configuration` discipline

For Assessors
-------------

- Review complete :doc:`safety_case`
- Examine :doc:`analyses/index` for safety evidence
- Check :doc:`compliance/traceability` for standards mapping
- Verify :doc:`verification` evidence

Manual Maintenance
==================

Version Control
---------------

This manual is version-controlled with the PulseEngine source code. Changes to safety-critical components must be reflected in this manual.

Review Process
--------------

All changes to this manual require:

1. Technical review by safety engineer
2. Verification of consistency with implementation
3. Update of traceability matrices
4. Impact analysis on safety case

Change History
--------------

See :doc:`../changelog` for version history and safety-relevant changes.
