WebAssembly Runtime Safety Guidelines
==================================

Introduction
-----------

This document provides guidelines for safely utilizing the bounded collections and memory safety features
in the WebAssembly Runtime (WRT). These guidelines are intended to ensure that applications meet safety
requirements and conform to the design principles established in the Functional Safety Plan.

Bounded Collections
------------------

Usage Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Always specify capacity limits**:
   
   * When creating bounded collections, always provide explicit capacity limits.
   * Do not use defaults unless you have verified they are appropriate for your use case.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Good practice: Explicit capacity
      let stack = BoundedStack::<u32>::with_capacity(256);
      
      // Avoid: Using defaults without consideration
      let stack = BoundedStack::<u32>::default();

2. **Handle capacity errors**:
   
   * Always check return values for push operations.
   * Implement appropriate error handling for capacity overflows.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Good practice: Error handling
      if let Err(e) = stack.push(value) {
          if let BoundedError::CapacityExceeded { .. } = e {
              // Handle capacity overflow appropriately
              log::warn!("Stack capacity exceeded: {}", e);
              // Take recovery action
          }
      }

3. **Verification levels**:
   
   * Use ``VerificationLevel::Full`` for critical operations where safety is paramount.
   * Use ``VerificationLevel::Standard`` for normal operations.
   * Use ``VerificationLevel::Sampling`` for performance-critical paths that still need some validation.
   * Only use ``VerificationLevel::None`` when maximum performance is required and safety is ensured by other means.

4. **Regular validation**:
   
   * Periodically call ``validate()`` on bounded collections to ensure integrity.
   * Consider validating after complex operation sequences.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Validate after a sequence of operations
      stack.push(value)?;
      process_data(&mut stack);
      stack.validate()?; // Validates the stack integrity

Safe Memory Operations
---------------------

Safety Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Bounds checking**:
   
   * Always use SafeSlice for memory access to ensure bounds checking.
   * Verify that memory operations stay within allocated bounds.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Good practice: Using SafeSlice for bounds-checked access
      let safe_slice = SafeSlice::new(memory_buffer);
      safe_slice.copy_from_slice(offset, &data)?;

2. **Checksumming**:
   
   * Enable checksumming for critical memory regions.
   * Validate checksums before and after significant operations.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Validate checksum before critical operations
      safe_memory.validate_checksum()?;
      perform_critical_operation(&safe_memory);
      safe_memory.validate_checksum()?;

3. **Verification levels for memory**:
   
   * Consider memory safety requirements when selecting verification levels.
   * Use ``VerificationLevel::Full`` when processing untrusted data.
   * Use ``VerificationLevel::Standard`` for most operations.

4. **Memory adapters**:
   
   * Use SafeMemoryAdapter when interfacing with WebAssembly memory.
   * Configure adapters with appropriate verification levels based on context.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Create adapter with appropriate verification level
      let adapter = SafeMemoryAdapter::with_verification_level(
          memory.clone(),
          VerificationLevel::Standard
      );

Engine Integration
-----------------

Safety Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Validation checkpoints**:
   
   * Add validation checkpoints at critical execution stages.
   * Validate state before and after significant control flow changes.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Validate engine state at critical points
      engine.validate()?;
      execute_wasm_function(...)?;
      engine.validate()?;

2. **Error handling strategy**:
   
   * Implement graceful error handling for safety violations.
   * Consider safe fallback strategies for critical applications.

   .. code-block:: rust

      match result {
          Ok(value) => process_value(value),
          Err(Error::SafetyViolation(e)) => {
              log::error!("Safety violation detected: {}", e);
              // Implement fallback or recovery
              recovery_action();
          }
          Err(e) => handle_other_error(e),
      }

3. **Operation tracking**:
   
   * Enable operation tracking for critical applications.
   * Monitor operation statistics to detect anomalies.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Check operation stats for anomalies
      let stats = engine.execution_stats();
      if stats.memory_operations > MEMORY_OP_THRESHOLD {
          log::warn!("Excessive memory operations detected");
      }

Fuzzing and Testing
------------------

Validation Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Use provided fuzzers**:
   
   * Run the fuzzing infrastructure regularly to identify issues.
   * Use specific fuzzers for different collection types.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Run fuzzers for different components
      cargo fuzz run fuzz_safe_slice
      cargo fuzz run fuzz_bounded_vec
      cargo fuzz run fuzz_bounded_stack
      cargo fuzz run fuzz_memory_adapter

2. **Validation tests**:
   
   * Implement validation tests for your specific use cases.
   * Test with different verification levels to understand tradeoffs.

3. **Benchmarking**:
   
   * Run performance benchmarks to measure the impact of safety features.
   * Use results to select appropriate verification levels.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Run benchmarks to measure performance impact
      cargo bench --bench safe_memory_benchmarks

Performance Considerations
------------------------

1. **Verification level selection**:
   
   * Balance safety and performance requirements.
   * Consider using different verification levels for different components.

2. **Batching validation**:
   
   * Batch validation operations to amortize costs.
   * Validate state at strategic points rather than after every operation.

3. **Optimizing critical paths**:
   
   * Identify and optimize performance-critical paths.
   * Consider using optimized verification strategies in hot paths.

   .. code-block:: rust

      // Optimize verification for hot paths
      #[cfg(feature = "optimize")]
      let verification = VerificationLevel::Sampling;
      #[cfg(not(feature = "optimize"))]
      let verification = VerificationLevel::Standard;
      
      let stack = BoundedStack::<u32>::with_capacity_and_verification(
          capacity,
          verification
      );

Certification and Compliance
---------------------------

1. **Documentation**:
   
   * Document safety features and verification strategies.
   * Maintain evidence of safety verification for certification.

2. **Traceability**:
   
   * Ensure requirements traceability to safety features.
   * Document safety case evidence for compliance.

3. **Verification**:
   
   * Implement regular verification processes.
   * Consider formal verification for critical components.

Conclusion
---------

Following these guidelines will help ensure the safe use of bounded collections and memory safety features
in the WebAssembly Runtime. By appropriately handling capacity limits, implementing proper error handling,
and selecting suitable verification levels, applications can achieve both safety and performance.

Regular validation, testing with the provided fuzzing infrastructure, and performance benchmarking
are essential practices for maintaining safety throughout the development lifecycle.
