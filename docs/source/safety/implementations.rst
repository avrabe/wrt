Overview
--------

This document provides details on how the safety requirements and mechanisms are implemented in the codebase. Implementation details are organized by functional area.

Memory Safety Implementations
-----------------------------

.. impl:: Memory Bounds Checking
   :id: IMPL_MEM_SAFETY_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_MEM_SAFETY_001, SAFETY_MEM_001

   Memory access validation is implemented with comprehensive bounds checking that prevents out-of-bounds access.

.. impl:: Safe Memory Adapter
   :id: IMPL_MEM_SAFETY_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_MEM_SAFETY_002, SAFETY_MEM_002

   A safe memory adapter is implemented to ensure that all WebAssembly memory accesses are properly validated.

Resource Management Implementations
-----------------------------------

.. impl:: Resource Limits
   :id: IMPL_RESOURCE_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_RESOURCE_001, SAFETY_RESOURCE_001

   Explicit resource limits are implemented for memory usage, stack depth, call depth, and execution time.

.. impl:: Bounded Collections
   :id: IMPL_RESOURCE_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_RESOURCE_002, SAFETY_RESOURCE_002

   All collections have explicit capacity limits with proper overflow handling to prevent resource exhaustion.

Verification Implementations
----------------------------

.. impl:: Verification Levels
   :id: IMPL_VERIFY_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_VERIFY_001

   Different verification levels are implemented to allow balancing safety and performance.

.. impl:: Engine State Verification
   :id: IMPL_VERIFY_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_VERIFY_004

   Engine state verification is implemented to ensure that the engine state is valid during execution.

WebAssembly-Specific Implementations
------------------------------------

.. impl:: Module Validation
   :id: IMPL_WASM_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_WASM_001

   WebAssembly module validation is implemented to ensure that all modules are valid before execution.

.. impl:: Import Function Validation
   :id: IMPL_WASM_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_WASM_002

   WebAssembly import function validation is implemented to ensure that all imports are valid and compatible.

Testing Implementations
-----------------------

.. impl:: Test Coverage
   :id: IMPL_TEST_COV_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_QA_001, IMPL_SAFETY_TESTING_001
   
   The testing infrastructure measures and enforces minimum coverage thresholds.

.. impl:: Safety Tests
   :id: IMPL_SAFETY_TEST_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_SAFETY_002, IMPL_SAFETY_TESTING_001
   
   Safety tests verify all safety mechanisms work as expected.

.. impl:: Fuzzing Infrastructure
   :id: IMPL_FUZZ_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_QA_003, IMPL_SAFETY_TESTING_001
   
   The fuzzing infrastructure helps identify unexpected edge cases that could lead to safety issues.

Implementation Status
