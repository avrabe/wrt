Overview
--------

Safety mechanisms are specific design features, architectural elements, or runtime checks that ensure safety properties are maintained. This document details the mechanisms used in the WebAssembly Runtime to implement safety requirements.

Memory Safety Mechanisms
------------------------

.. safety:: Memory Bounds Checking
   :id: SAFETY_MEM_001
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: All memory accesses include bounds validation with proper error handling.

   Prevention of out-of-bounds memory access through comprehensive bounds checking.

.. safety:: Safe Memory Adapter
   :id: SAFETY_MEM_002
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: A safe memory adapter is provided for all WebAssembly memory interactions.

   The safe memory adapter ensures that all memory operations are validated before execution.

Resource Management Mechanisms
------------------------------

.. safety:: Resource Limits
   :id: SAFETY_RESOURCE_001
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: All resources have explicit limits configured during runtime initialization.

   Explicit resource limits prevent resource exhaustion and ensure deterministic behavior.

.. safety:: Bounded Collections
   :id: SAFETY_RESOURCE_002
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: All collections have explicit capacity limits with proper overflow handling.

   Prevents memory exhaustion by limiting collection sizes and handling capacity errors gracefully.

Recovery Mechanisms
-------------------

.. safety:: Error Recovery
   :id: SAFETY_RECOVERY_001
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: Error recovery mechanisms for graceful degradation.

   Ensures the system can recover from errors and continue operating in a degraded mode if needed.

.. safety:: State Migration
   :id: SAFETY_RECOVERY_002
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: State migration capabilities ensure that execution state can be saved and restored.

   Enables checkpointing and recovery of execution state.

Import Safety Mechanisms
------------------------

.. safety:: Import Validation
   :id: SAFETY_IMPORTS_001
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: All WebAssembly imports undergo rigorous validation before use.

   Ensures that all imports are valid and compatible with the expected interface.

.. safety:: Host Function Safety
   :id: SAFETY_IMPORTS_002
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: Host functions validate all inputs from WebAssembly modules.

   Prevents invalid inputs from WebAssembly modules affecting host system stability.

Unsafe Code Mechanisms
----------------------

.. safety:: Unsafe Code Review
   :id: SAFETY_UNSAFE_001
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: All unsafe code undergoes rigorous review and has explicit test cases.

   Ensures that all unsafe code blocks are properly reviewed and tested to maintain safety properties.

.. safety:: Unsafe Code Documentation
   :id: SAFETY_UNSAFE_002
   :status: implemented
   :mitigation: All unsafe code is documented with justification and invariants.

   Clear documentation of all unsafe code blocks with rationale and safety requirements.

Implementation Status
