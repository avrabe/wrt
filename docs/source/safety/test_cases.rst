Overview
--------

This document lists the test cases designed to verify that safety requirements have been correctly implemented. Each test case is linked to the relevant requirements and implementations.

Memory Safety Test Cases
------------------------

.. test:: Memory Bounds Check Test
   :id: T_MEM_SAFETY_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_MEM_SAFETY_001, IMPL_BOUNDS_CHECK_001

   Tests that memory access validation correctly prevents out-of-bounds access and reports errors.

.. test:: SafeSlice Test
   :id: T_MEM_SAFETY_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_MEM_SAFETY_001, IMPL_SAFE_SLICE_001

   Validates that SafeSlice correctly enforces memory bounds and properly handles edge cases.

Resource Management Test Cases
------------------------------

.. test:: Resource Limit Test
   :id: T_RESOURCE_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_RESOURCE_001, IMPL_RESOURCE_LIMITS_001

   Verifies that resource limits are correctly enforced and limit violations are properly handled.

.. test:: Bounded Collections Test
   :id: T_RESOURCE_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_RESOURCE_002, IMPL_BOUNDED_COLL_001

   Tests that bounded collections correctly enforce capacity limits and handle overflow conditions.

Verification Test Cases
-----------------------

.. test:: Verification Level Test
   :id: T_VERIFY_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_VERIFY_001, IMPL_VERIFY_LEVEL_001

   Verifies that different verification levels correctly apply the expected safety checks.

.. test:: Engine State Verification Test
   :id: T_VERIFY_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_VERIFY_004, IMPL_ENGINE_VERIFY_001

   Tests that engine state verification correctly identifies invalid states and handles them appropriately.

WebAssembly-Specific Test Cases
-------------------------------

.. test:: Module Validation Test
   :id: T_WASM_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_WASM_001, IMPL_VALIDATE_001

   Verifies that WebAssembly module validation correctly identifies and rejects invalid modules.

.. test:: Import Function Validation Test
   :id: T_WASM_002
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_WASM_002, IMPL_IMPORT_SAFETY_001

   Tests that WebAssembly import functions correctly validate parameters and handle error cases.

Build and Environment Test Cases
--------------------------------

.. test:: Clean Build Test
   :id: T_BUILD_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_BUILD_001, IMPL_BUILD_CONFIG_001

   Verifies that the build system correctly handles clean builds and detects configuration issues.

.. test:: Environment Variable Test
   :id: T_ENV_001
   :status: implemented
   :links: REQ_ENV_001, IMPL_CONFIG_001

   Tests that environment variables are correctly processed and validated.
