   **Preliminary Implementation Status**
   
   The WRT universal safety system is currently in a preliminary state. This validation guide provides recommendations for how to validate the system, but actual validation must be performed by qualified safety engineers and approved by relevant certification authorities before deployment in safety-critical applications.

Overview
--------

The WRT universal safety classification system requires validation across multiple dimensions:

1. **Cross-Standard Mapping Validation**: Verify severity score mappings between standards
2. **Domain-Specific Validation**: Validate applicability to specific industry domains  
3. **Implementation Verification**: Verify software implementation matches safety requirements
4. **Certification Authority Approval**: Obtain approval from relevant certification bodies

Cross-Standard Mapping Validation
----------------------------------

Severity Score Research Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current severity score mappings (0-1000 scale) are based on research analysis. To validate for certification:

**1. Literature Review Validation**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Required documentation review:
   - ISO 26262 Parts 1-12 (Automotive)
   - DO-178C and DO-254 (Aerospace) 
   - IEC 61508 Parts 1-7 (Industrial)
   - IEC 62304 (Medical Device Software)
   - EN 50128 (Railway Applications)
   - ISO 25119 Parts 1-4 (Agricultural Machinery)

**2. Quantitative Analysis Validation**

For each standard, validate the severity mapping by:

- Reviewing failure rate requirements where specified
- Analyzing risk matrices and assessment criteria  
- Comparing with published cross-standard studies
- Consulting with domain experts and certification authorities

**3. Conservative Mapping Verification**

Verify that conservative mapping decisions are appropriate:

.. code-block:: rust

   // Example validation test
   use wrt_foundation::safety_system::*;
   
   // Verify QM cannot map to medical (conservative decision)
   let qm = SafetyStandard::Iso26262(AsilLevel::QM);
   assert!(qm.convert_to(SafetyStandardType::Iec62304).is_none());
   
   // Verify mappings are conservative (higher safety when ambiguous)
   let asil_b = SafetyStandard::Iso26262(AsilLevel::AsilB);
   let sil_2 = SafetyStandard::Iec61508(SilLevel::Sil2);
   
   // Both should be compatible with each other at 500 severity
   assert!(asil_b.is_compatible_with(&sil_2));
   assert!(sil_2.is_compatible_with(&asil_b));

Domain-Specific Validation

Implementation Verification
---------------------------

Code Review and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Static Analysis Requirements:**

   cargo audit
   cargo deny check
   
   # Safety-specific analysis
   cargo +nightly miri test  # Memory safety verification
   cargo +nightly kani      # Formal verification (where available)

**Dynamic Testing Requirements:**

1. **Unit Testing**: 100% safety function coverage
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-standard conversion testing
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end safety context testing
4. **Stress Testing**: Concurrent access and edge cases

**Code Review Checklist:**

.. code-block:: text

   Safety Code Review Checklist:
   ☐ All unsafe code blocks documented and justified
   ☐ Atomic operations use correct memory ordering
   ☐ Error handling covers all failure modes
   ☐ Conservative behavior in ambiguous cases
   ☐ Requirements traceability complete
   ☐ No hardcoded safety assumptions
   ☐ Proper const function usage for compile-time checks

Formal Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For highest assurance levels (ASIL-D, DAL-A, SIL-4, Class C), formal verification may be required:

**Verification Properties:**

1. **Safety Monotonicity**: Safety level can only increase, never decrease
2. **Cross-Standard Consistency**: Equivalent levels have equivalent protections
3. **Atomic Operation Safety**: No race conditions in safety state updates
4. **Conservative Mapping**: All conversions maintain or increase safety requirements

**Tools and Methods:**

- **Kani**: Rust verification for bounded model checking
- **CBMC**: C bounded model checker for unsafe code blocks  
- **TLA+**: Specification and verification of concurrent algorithms
- **Coq/Lean**: Proof assistants for mathematical verification
