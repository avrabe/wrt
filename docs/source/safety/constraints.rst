User Responsibility Constraints
------------------------------

.. constraint:: User Responsibility
   :id: CNST_USER_RESP
   :rationale: The WRT provides safety mechanisms, but cannot guarantee safety if used incorrectly.
   :verification: Review of user documentation and integration testing.
   :links: REQ_SAFETY_001, QUAL_DOCS_001
   :status: Active

   The user is responsible for correctly integrating and using the WebAssembly Runtime within their application. The safety guarantees of the runtime are only valid when all specified constraints are followed.

.. constraint:: Bug Reporting
   :id: CNST_BUG_REPORT
   :rationale: Safety-critical issues must be identified and resolved in a timely manner.
   :verification: Review of issue tracking system.
   :links: REQ_QA_002, IMPL_ISSUE_001
   :status: Active

   Users must report any observed failures, unexpected behaviors, or safety-related concerns through the official issue tracking system. Each report should include:

   * Description of the observed behavior
   * Expected behavior
   * Steps to reproduce
   * Environment details (hardware, OS, compiler version)
   * Impact assessment on safety

Installation Constraints
-----------------------

.. constraint:: Installation Prerequisites
   :id: CNST_INSTALL_PREREQ
   :rationale: Proper environment setup is essential for correct runtime behavior.
   :verification: Installation verification tests.
   :links: REQ_INSTALL_001, IMPL_DEPS_001, T_INSTALL_001

   The following prerequisites must be correctly installed before using the WebAssembly Runtime:

   * Rust toolchain (minimum version 1.70)
   * Required build dependencies as specified in the README
   * For development: just command runner and python for documentation

.. constraint:: Installation Validation
   :id: CNST_INSTALL_VALID
   :rationale: Ensure the installation is correct before using in safety-critical applications.
   :verification: Execution of validation tests.
   :links: REQ_INSTALL_002, T_INSTALL_VALID_001, IMPL_TEST_001
   :status: Active

   After installation, execute the validation tests to verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Run validation tests
      just test-validation

   A successful test run confirms the installation is valid.
