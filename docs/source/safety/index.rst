Safety Requirements
-------------------

For details on specific safety requirements, see the :doc:`../requirements/safety` page.

Qualification Scope
-------------------

The WebAssembly Runtime has been developed with safety considerations appropriate for:

* Embedded systems with safety requirements
* Isolated execution environments for untrusted code
* Systems requiring deterministic resource usage
* Applications with memory safety requirements

Target Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WebAssembly Runtime is designed for, but not limited to, the following applications:

* Embedded systems with mixed-criticality software
* IoT devices requiring isolation between components
* Edge computing platforms executing untrusted code
* Systems requiring predictable resource usage
* Applications requiring memory isolation between components

Safety Certification Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The safety certification approach for the WebAssembly Runtime includes:

* Static verification of critical components
* Dynamic verification through test suites
* Code review by safety experts
* Formal verification of core algorithms where applicable
* Hazard and risk analysis

Safety-Critical Features
------------------------

Memory Safety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WebAssembly Runtime implements several memory safety features to prevent out-of-bounds memory access that could corrupt system memory. All memory accesses must be validated against defined boundaries. Use SafeSlice for all memory operations to ensure bounds checking.

Resource Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always define explicit resource limits for:

* Memory usage (pages)
* Stack depth
* Call depth
* Execution time/instruction count

Bounded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using bounded collections, always provide explicit capacity limits and handle capacity errors appropriately.

.. code-block:: rust

   // Good practice: Explicit capacity
   let stack = BoundedStack::<u32>::with_capacity(256);
   
   // Handle capacity errors
   if let Err(e) = stack.push(value) {
       if let BoundedError::CapacityExceeded { .. } = e {
           // Handle capacity overflow appropriately
           log::warn!("Stack capacity exceeded: {}", e);
           // Take recovery action
       }
   }

For more details on specific safety mechanisms, see :doc:`mechanisms`.

User Interactions
-----------------

2.1 Support Requests and Bug Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users must report any observed failures, unexpected behaviors, or safety-related concerns through the official issue tracking system. Each report should include:

* Description of the observed behavior
* Expected behavior
* Steps to reproduce
* Environment details (hardware, OS, compiler version)
* Impact assessment on safety

2.2 Obtaining Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The complete documentation, including this Safety Manual, is available through:

* Source repository documentation directory
* Generated HTML/PDF documentation
* API documentation generated from source code comments

2.3 Consulting Known Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users should regularly check the known problems section in the official repository to stay informed about identified issues and available workarounds.

Installation Procedures
-----------------------

3.1 Installing Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following prerequisites must be correctly installed before using the WebAssembly Runtime:

* Rust toolchain (minimum version 1.86.0)
* Required build dependencies as specified in the README
* For development: just command runner and python for documentation

3.2 Installing the Runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the installation instructions in the README.md file:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install Rust (if not already installed)
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

   # Install just command runner (for development)
   cargo install just

   # Setup project dependencies
   just setup

3.3 Installation Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installation, execute the validation tests to verify the installation:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run validation tests
   just test-validation

A successful test run confirms the installation is valid.

Usage
-----

4.1 Cleaning the Build Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before building for safety-critical applications, ensure a clean build environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clean build artifacts
   just clean

   # Build from clean state
   just build

4.2 Warnings and Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All compiler warnings must be treated as errors and addressed before deployment in safety-critical applications. Use:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build with warnings treated as errors
   RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" just build

4.3 Building WebAssembly Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When building WebAssembly modules for use with this runtime, follow these safety guidelines:

* Use memory-safe languages where possible
* Enable all compiler safety checks
* Validate WebAssembly modules before execution
* Set appropriate resource limits

4.4 Creating Host Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When implementing host functions:

* Validate all inputs from WebAssembly modules
* Handle all error cases explicitly
* Implement resource limitation and monitoring
* Use the SafeMemoryAdapter for memory access

Verification Levels
-------------------

The runtime supports different verification levels for balancing safety and performance. Select the appropriate verification level based on safety criticality:

* ``VerificationLevel::Full`` - For safety-critical operations
* ``VerificationLevel::Standard`` - For normal operations
* ``VerificationLevel::Sampling`` - For performance-critical paths
* ``VerificationLevel::None`` - For non-safety-critical, performance-sensitive paths
