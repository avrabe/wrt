Risk Mitigation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All identified hazards are either:

- **Mitigated to acceptable levels** through architectural and process controls
- **Verified through formal methods** and comprehensive testing

Technical Safety Concept
------------------------

Memory Safety Concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Static Allocation Only**
   
   - No malloc/free in safety-critical paths
   - All memory pre-allocated at initialization
   - Compile-time size verification

2. **Capability-Based Access Control**
   
   - Every memory access requires valid capability
   - Capabilities cannot be forged or escalated
   - Automatic cleanup via RAII

3. **Budget Enforcement**
   
   - Per-crate memory budgets defined at compile-time
   - Hierarchical budget management
   - Runtime verification of budget compliance

Error Handling Concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **No Implicit Failures**
   
   - All fallible operations return ``Result<T, E>``
   - Errors must be explicitly handled
   - No unwrap() in production code

2. **ASIL-Level Error Classification**
   
   - Errors tagged with appropriate ASIL level
   - Safety-critical errors escalated appropriately
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical errors

3. **Error Propagation Verification**
   
   - KANI proofs verify error propagation correctness
   - Error context preserved through call chain
   - Recovery mechanisms validated

Fault Detection Concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Runtime Checks**
   
   - Bounds checking on all array accesses
   - Overflow checking in release builds
   - Null pointer checks (where applicable)

2. **Fault Isolation**
   
   - Component boundaries enforce isolation
   - Faults cannot propagate across components
   - Each component has independent resource pool

3. **Fault Recovery**
   
   - Transient faults handled through retry
   - Permanent faults trigger graceful degradation
   - System maintains safe state after faults
