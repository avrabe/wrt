Safety Analysis Report
=====================

This document contains the safety analysis for the WebAssembly Runtime (WRT) project.

Introduction
------------

This safety analysis identifies potential hazards that could arise from the use of the WRT runtime in safety-critical applications and evaluates their potential impact. It also identifies mitigation strategies to address these hazards.

Hazard Identification
--------------------

This section identifies potential hazards in the WRT system and their mitigations.

.. needfilter::
   :types: req
   :regex_filter: title, .*[Ss]afety.*|.*[Bb]ound.*|.*[Ll]imit.*|.*[Hh]azard.*

.. safety:: Unbounded Execution
   :id: SAFETY_001
   :status: mitigated
   :links: REQ_003, REQ_007
   :mitigation: The WRT implements bounded execution using the fuel mechanism (REQ_003, REQ_007), ensuring that execution will always yield back control flow after a configurable number of operations.

   A WebAssembly module could enter an infinite loop, causing the host system to become unresponsive or consume excessive resources.

.. safety:: Memory Access Violations
   :id: SAFETY_002
   :status: mitigated
   :links: REQ_018
   :mitigation: The WRT implements strict memory bounds checking as part of the WebAssembly specification compliance. All memory accesses are validated before execution.

   Improper memory access could lead to data corruption or system crashes.

.. safety:: Resource Exhaustion
   :id: SAFETY_003
   :status: mitigated
   :links: REQ_014, REQ_024
   :mitigation: The WRT implements resource limits and tracking, ensuring that memory allocation is bounded and monitored. The efficient operand stack implementation (REQ_024) minimizes memory overhead.

   A WebAssembly module could exhaust system resources such as memory.

.. safety:: Interface Type Mismatch
   :id: SAFETY_004
   :status: mitigated
   :links: REQ_014, REQ_019
   :mitigation: The WRT strictly validates type compatibility as part of the Component Model implementation. Interface types are checked during component instantiation.

   Type mismatches at component interfaces could lead to incorrect data interpretation and potentially unsafe operations.

Risk Assessment
---------------

This section assesses the risk of each identified hazard.

Safety Validation
----------------

The following validation activities are required to ensure safety properties:

1. **Testing of Bounded Execution**
   - Verify that fuel consumption mechanism correctly limits execution
   - Test with modules containing infinite loops
   - Verify deterministic behavior when execution is resumed

2. **Memory Safety Testing**
   - Test memory access at boundaries
   - Verify out-of-bounds access is properly trapped
   - Validate memory growth constraints

3. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Test memory allocation limits
   - Verify proper cleanup of resources
   - Validate that peak memory usage is accurately tracked

4. **Interface Type Validation**
   - Test type validation with malformed components
   - Verify correct validation of interface types
   - Test with boundary conditions for complex types
