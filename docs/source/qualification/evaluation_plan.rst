Evaluation Plan
===============

This document defines the evaluation approach for the WRT project to determine qualification levels and activities.

Introduction
------------

The evaluation plan establishes the criteria for determining the appropriate qualification levels for the WRT project and outlines the activities required to meet those levels.

Qualification Levels Assessment
-------------------------------

This section assesses the target qualification levels for the WRT project.

.. qual:: ISO-26262 Qualification Level
   :id: QUAL_100
   :item_status: targeted
   :implementation: The WRT targets ASIL D qualification according to ISO-26262 for automotive applications.

   ASIL D is the highest automotive safety integrity level and requires:
   - Systematic capability 4
   - Diagnostic coverage >99%
   - Single-point fault metric >99%
   - Latent fault metric >90%
   - Full statement, branch, and MC/DC coverage

.. qual:: IEC-61508 Qualification Level
   :id: QUAL_101
   :item_status: targeted
   :implementation: The WRT targets SIL 3 qualification according to IEC-61508 for general functional safety applications.

   SIL 3 requires:
   - High diagnostic coverage
   - Redundancy through diverse implementations
   - Formal verification of critical algorithms
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Static analysis with no critical findings

.. qual:: IEC-62304 Qualification Level
   :id: QUAL_102
   :item_status: targeted
   :implementation: The WRT targets Class C qualification according to IEC-62304 for medical device software.

   Class C is for software that could directly contribute to serious injury or death, requiring:
   - Complete documentation
   - Risk management
   - Design verification and validation
   - Full traceability
   - Comprehensive testing

Safety Criticality Assessment
-----------------------------

This section assesses the safety criticality of the WRT components.

   * - Component
     - Criticality
     - Rationale
   * - wrt-runtime
     - High
     - Core execution engine that handles all WebAssembly instructions
   * - wrt-instructions
     - High
     - Implements instruction semantics crucial for correct execution
   * - wrt-component
     - Medium
     - Handles interface types but doesn't affect core execution
   * - wrt-sync
     - High
     - Critical for thread safety and resource coordination
   * - wrt-logging
     - Low
     - Observability component not directly affecting execution
   * - wrtd
     - Medium
     - Command-line interface that mediates access to runtime

Qualification Activities Plan
-----------------------------

The following activities are required for qualification:

1. **Requirements Verification**
   - Formal review of requirements
   - Completeness analysis
   - MCDC test coverage of requirements
   - Traceability to specifications

2. **Architecture Verification**
   - Formal review of architecture
   - Interface analysis
   - Error handling analysis
   - Resource usage analysis

3. **Implementation Verification**
   - Static analysis
   - Dynamic analysis
   - Formal verification where applicable
   - Code review

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing (100% statement coverage)
   - Integration testing (100% branch coverage)
   - System testing
   - Performance testing
   - MCDC testing for safety-critical components

5. **Documentation**
   - Requirements documentation
   - Architecture documentation
   - Implementation documentation
   - Test documentation
   - Traceability documentation
   - Safety analysis
   - Qualification evidence
