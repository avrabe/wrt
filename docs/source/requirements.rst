   for target operating systems (macOS, Linux, QNX, Zephyr) and bare-metal environments, 
   selectable via compile-time features. The PAL shall abstract OS-specific APIs for 
   memory allocation/protection and synchronization primitives (futex-like operations).

.. req:: Resumable Interpreter
   :id: REQ_FUNC_001

.. req:: Minimize Code Complexity for Certification
   :id: REQ_LFUNC_026
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_OBS_012, REQ_OBS_013

   To enhance certifiability and maintainability, the WRT interpreter codebase shall strive for simplicity, minimize the use of complex language features (e.g., procedural macros), and restrict external dependencies to those strictly necessary for core functionality or explicitly required features (like logging or `no_std` math).
