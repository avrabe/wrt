Requirements
============

This section contains the requirements for the WRT project.

Functional Requirements
---------------------

.. req:: Resumable Interpreter
   :id: REQ_001
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall be resumable, allowing operation with fuel or other implementations of bounded run-time that require the interpreter to be halted and later resumed as if it was not halted.

.. req:: Baremetal Support
   :id: REQ_002
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall be executable on bare-metal environments with no reliance on any specific functionality from the provided execution environment, as it shall be ready for embedding to any environment that Rust can compile for.

.. req:: Bounded Execution
   :id: REQ_003
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall yield back control flow eventually, allowing users to call the interpreter with a bound and expect a result in a finite amount of time or bytecode operations, even if the bytecode itself never finishes execution.

.. req:: State Migration
   :id: REQ_004
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter state shall be able to halt on one computer and continue execution on another, enabling various workflows in deployments of multiple computers for load-balancing or redundancy purposes.

.. req:: WebAssembly Component Model Support
   :id: REQ_014
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall implement the WebAssembly Component Model Preview 2 specification, including:
   - Component model validation
   - Resource type handling
   - Interface types
   - Component instantiation and linking
   - Resource lifetime management
   - Custom section handling
   - Component model binary format parsing

.. req:: WASI Logging Support
   :id: REQ_015
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall implement the WASI logging API as specified in the wasi-logging proposal, providing:
   - Support for all defined log levels (Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace)
   - Context-based logging
   - Stderr integration
   - Thread-safe logging operations

.. req:: Platform-Specific Logging
   :id: REQ_016
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_015
   
   The WASI logging implementation shall provide platform-specific backends:
   - Linux: syslog integration with proper facility and priority mapping
   - macOS: Unified Logging System (os_log) integration
   - Generic fallback implementation for other platforms

Low-Level Functional Requirements
--------------------------------

.. req:: Stackless Implementation
   :id: REQ_005
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_001
   
   The interpreter shall be stackless, storing the stack of the interpreted bytecode in a traditional data structure rather than using function calls in the host environment.

.. req:: No Standard Library
   :id: REQ_006
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_002
   
   The interpreter shall be implemented in no_std Rust, only relying on functionality provided by no_std to enable execution on bare environments where no operating system is available.

.. req:: Fuel Mechanism
   :id: REQ_007
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_003
   
   The interpreter shall support fuel bounded execution, where each bytecode instruction is associated with a specific amount of fuel consumed during execution.

.. req:: State Serialization
   :id: REQ_008
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_004
   
   The interpreter state shall be de-/serializable to enable migration to other computers and support check-point/lock-step execution.

.. req:: WebAssembly Core Implementation
   :id: REQ_018
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_014
   
   The interpreter shall implement the WebAssembly Core specification, including:
   - Value types and reference types
   - Instructions and control flow
   - Function calls and tables
   - Memory and data segments
   - Global variables
   - Exception handling
   - SIMD operations
   - Threading support

.. req:: Component Model Implementation
   :id: REQ_019
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_014
   
   The interpreter shall implement the Component Model specification, including:
   - WIT format parsing and validation
   - Component model binary format parsing
   - Resource type implementation
   - Interface type handling
   - Component instantiation
   - Component linking
   - Resource lifetime management

Dependency Requirements
---------------------

.. req:: Logging Support
   :id: REQ_009
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall have an optional dependency on the ``log`` crate version ``0.4.22`` for observability and debugging purposes.

.. req:: Math Library
   :id: REQ_010
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter may depend on the ``libm`` crate version ``0.2.8`` for floating-point operations required in no_std environments.

.. req:: Rust Version
   :id: REQ_011
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall compile on Rust ``1.76.0`` and later versions.

.. req:: Component Model Tools
   :id: REQ_020
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_014
   
   The interpreter shall use the following tools for Component Model development:
   - wit-parser >= 0.12.0 for WIT file parsing and validation
   - wit-bindgen >= 0.12.0 for interface generation
   - wit-component >= 0.12.0 for component model binary format handling

Observability Requirements
------------------------

.. req:: Instrumentation Support
   :id: REQ_012
   :status: planned
   
   The interpreter shall implement means for instrumentation to support certification evidence generation, debugging, and run-time monitoring.

.. req:: Coverage Measurement
   :id: REQ_013
   :status: planned
   :links: REQ_012
   
   The instrumentation shall enable the measurement of:
   
   - Statement coverage (DO-178C DAL-C)
   - Decision coverage (DO-178C DAL-B)
   - Modified condition/decision coverage (DO-178C DAL-A)

Implementation Status
-------------------

.. needtable::
   :columns: id;title;status
   :filter: type == 'req'

Requirement Relationships
-----------------------

.. needflow::
   :filter: id in ['REQ_001', 'REQ_002', 'REQ_003', 'REQ_004', 'REQ_005', 'REQ_006', 'REQ_007', 'REQ_008', 'REQ_009', 'REQ_010', 'REQ_011', 'REQ_012', 'REQ_013', 'REQ_014', 'REQ_015', 'REQ_016', 'REQ_017', 'REQ_018', 'REQ_019', 'REQ_020']
