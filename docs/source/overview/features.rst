Core Features
-------------

WebAssembly Core Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPE_wrt provides a complete implementation of the WebAssembly Core specification:

- **Full specification compliance**: All WebAssembly Core features fully implemented
- **Deterministic execution**: Predictable behavior for safety-critical applications
- **Bounded execution**: Control over execution time and resource usage
- **Memory safety**: Comprehensive bounds checking and memory isolation

Component Model Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Full implementation of WebAssembly Component Model Preview 2:

- **Interface types**: Defining clear boundaries between components
- **Resource types**: Proper handling of resource ownership
- **Canonical ABI**: Standard interface for cross-language compatibility
- **Component instantiation**: Dynamic loading and linking of components

Platform Integration
--------------------

Logging and Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Platform-specific logging**: Native integration with system logging
- **Diagnostic interfaces**: Comprehensive error reporting and state inspection
- **WASI logging**: Support for the WebAssembly System Interface logging

Bare-Metal Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **No operating system requirements**: Can run directly on hardware
- **Minimal dependencies**: Designed for resource-constrained environments
- **Hardware abstraction**: Clean interface to underlying hardware

Safety Features
---------------

State Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **State migration**: Transfer execution state between instances
- **Checkpointing**: Save and restore execution state
- **State verification**: Validate execution state integrity

Resource Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Memory limits**: Control WebAssembly memory allocation
- **Execution fuel**: Bounded execution with predictable cycles
- **Stack bounds**: Prevent stack overflow conditions

Application Domains
-------------------

The runtime is particularly suitable for:

- **IoT devices**: Secure execution of third-party code
- **Medical systems**: Deterministic behavior for patient safety
- **Automotive**: Isolated execution environments for vehicle systems
- **Avionics**: Predictable performance for flight systems
- **Edge computing**: Secure execution at the network edge

Performance Characteristics
---------------------------

- **Predictable execution time**: Consistent operation for real-time systems
- **Minimal memory overhead**: Efficient resource usage
- **Stackless design**: Reduced memory requirements
- **Optimized interpreter**: Balance of performance and determinism

See :doc:`../architecture` for details on how these features are implemented.
