Core Features
-------------

WebAssembly Core Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PulseEngine provides WebAssembly Core infrastructure with the following implemented features:

- **Memory operations**: Complete load/store operations with bounds checking and memory isolation
- **Arithmetic instructions**: Full implementation of i32/i64/f32/f64 arithmetic operations
- **Type system**: Complete WebAssembly value types and type checking
- **Safety infrastructure**: Deterministic compilation and bounded execution framework

.. note::
   **Development Status**: Core WebAssembly instruction execution engine is currently under development. 
   Control flow, function calls, and module instantiation are partially implemented.

Component Model Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WebAssembly Component Model infrastructure in development:

- **Type definitions**: Component model type system and interface types
- **Parsing framework**: Component format parsing (element/data segments in progress)
- **Resource handling**: Basic resource type support
- **ABI foundations**: Canonical ABI type mapping infrastructure

.. note::
   **Development Status**: Component Model parsing and instantiation are under active development.

Platform Integration
--------------------

Logging and Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Platform-specific logging**: Native integration with system logging
- **Diagnostic interfaces**: Comprehensive error reporting and state inspection
- **WASI logging**: Support for the WebAssembly System Interface logging

Bare-Metal Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **No operating system requirements**: Can run directly on hardware
- **Minimal dependencies**: Designed for resource-constrained environments
- **Hardware abstraction**: Clean interface to underlying hardware

Safety Features
---------------

State Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **State migration**: Framework for execution state transfer (in development)
- **Checkpointing**: Infrastructure for state save/restore (planned)
- **State verification**: Execution context validation

Resource Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Memory limits**: Implemented WebAssembly memory allocation controls
- **Execution fuel**: Gas metering infrastructure (execution engine in development)
- **Stack bounds**: Function call depth limiting with overflow protection

Application Domains
-------------------

The runtime is particularly suitable for:

- **IoT devices**: Secure execution of third-party code
- **Medical systems**: Deterministic behavior for patient safety
- **Automotive**: Isolated execution environments for vehicle systems
- **Avionics**: Predictable performance for flight systems
- **Edge computing**: Secure execution at the network edge

Performance Characteristics
---------------------------

- **Predictable execution time**: Design goal for real-time systems (interpreter in development)
- **Minimal memory overhead**: Efficient no_std memory management implemented
- **Stackless design**: Stackless execution framework in development
- **Safety-first architecture**: ASIL compliance and formal verification infrastructure
