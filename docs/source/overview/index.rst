Introduction
------------

**PulseEngine (WRT Edition): Safety-Critical WebAssembly Infrastructure**

PulseEngine (WRT Edition) is a pure Rust implementation of WebAssembly infrastructure designed for safety-critical systems. It provides the foundational components for WebAssembly execution in environments where deterministic behavior, memory safety, and formal verification are essential, including IoT, medical devices, automotive, and avionics applications.

Key Capabilities
----------------

- **Memory Safety Foundation**: Complete WebAssembly memory operations with bounds checking
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Full implementation of WebAssembly numeric instructions
- **Type System**: Complete WebAssembly value types and validation infrastructure
- **Safety-Critical Design**: ASIL compliance framework with no_std support
- **Formal Verification**: Infrastructure for Kani proof verification
- **Development Status**: Core execution engine and component model under active development

.. note::
   **Current Status**: PulseEngine provides essential WebAssembly infrastructure components. 
   The instruction execution engine, control flow, and module instantiation are under development.
