Introduction
------------

**Pulseengine (WRT Edition): Precision Runtime for Mission-Critical Systems**

Pulseengine (WRT Edition), or PE_wrt for short, builds on our solid foundation—the interpreted WebAssembly runtime known as **wrt**—to offer an engine engineered for environments where every cycle matters. Drawing on hard-core, time-tested engineering principles and decades of experience in system reliability, Pulseengine delivers deterministic behavior, continuous oversight, and relentless precision, all essential for systems in IoT, medicine, automotive, and avionics.

Key Capabilities
----------------

- **Interpretation at Its Core**: Based on **wrt**, our engine interprets WebAssembly code with deterministic execution
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Built-in real-time checks to capture anomalies early
- **Steady Throughput**: Consistent performance guarantees with precise timing
- **Deterministic Execution**: Every cycle is predictable and verifiable
- **WebAssembly Core & Component Model**: Full implementation of specifications
- **Safety Features**: Stackless design, bounded execution, and state migration
