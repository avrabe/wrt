Quick Start
===========

For comprehensive installation instructions including prerequisites, platform-specific notes, and troubleshooting, see the :doc:`installation` guide.

For most development scenarios, follow these quick steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/pulseengine/wrt.git
      cd wrt

2. **Build and test** (requires Rust 1.86.0+):

   .. code-block:: bash

      cargo install --path cargo-wrt
      cargo-wrt build
      cargo-wrt test

Basic Usage
===========

Once installed, you can use PulseEngine in several ways:

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Run WebAssembly modules directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run a simple module
   cargo-wrt wrtd

   # Build and run example
   cargo run --bin wrtd -- module.wasm

Library Integration
-------------------

Add PulseEngine to your Rust project:

.. code-block:: toml

   [dependencies]
   wrt = { path = "wrt" }  # Adjust path or use published version

Basic runtime usage:

.. code-block:: rust

   use wrt::prelude::*;

   // Load and execute WebAssembly
   let module = Module::from_bytes(&wasm_bytes)?;
   let mut instance = ModuleInstance::new(module, imports)?;
   let result = instance.invoke("function_name", &args)?;

Component Model
---------------

Work with WebAssembly components:

.. code-block:: rust

   use wrt_component::prelude::*;

   // Load component with WIT interface
   let component = Component::from_bytes(&component_bytes)?;
   let instance = ComponentInstance::new(component, imports)?;
