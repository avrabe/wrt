Safety Architecture
==================

WRT Safety System Implementation
---------------------------------

This document describes the safety architecture for WRT, satisfying requirement REQ_SAFETY_001.

ASIL Context Maintenance
------------------------

The runtime maintains safety context with ASIL level tracking through:

* Safety system in wrt-foundation/src/safety_system.rs
* ASIL level enforcement and validation
* Safety context propagation across components
* ASIL-D compliance for highest safety integrity

Implementation Details
----------------------

The safety architecture ensures:

1. **ASIL Context Tracking**: Every operation maintains its safety level
2. **Safety Boundaries**: Clear separation between safety levels
3. **Integrity Checks**: Continuous validation of safety constraints

Verification
------------

Safety compliance is verified through:

* Comprehensive test coverage 
* ASIL-D tagged safety tests
* Static analysis for safety violations
* Formal verification methods

Safety Requirements
-------------------

This implementation satisfies:

* REQ_SAFETY_001: ASIL Context Maintenance
* ASIL Level: D (Highest Safety Integrity)
* Verification Status: In Progress
