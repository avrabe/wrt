Safety Architecture
==================

.. warning::
   **Legacy Documentation**: This is legacy design documentation. The safety system 
   implementation is under development as part of the overall safety-critical infrastructure.

WRT Safety System Design
------------------------

This document describes the intended safety architecture design for WRT.

Target ASIL Context Design
--------------------------

The planned runtime safety context includes:

* Safety system infrastructure in wrt-foundation/src/safety_system.rs (partial)
* ASIL level tracking framework (designed)
* Safety context propagation design (planned)
* ASIL-D preparation for highest safety integrity (not certified)

Design Components
-----------------

The safety architecture design includes:

1. **ASIL Context Tracking**: Framework for safety level maintenance (infrastructure exists)
2. **Safety Boundaries**: Design for separation between safety levels (planned)
3. **Integrity Checks**: Framework for safety constraint validation (under development)

Verification Approach
---------------------

Safety compliance verification approach:

* Test coverage framework (partial)
* ASIL-D tagged safety test design (infrastructure exists)
* Static analysis integration (planned)
* Formal verification approach (designed)

Requirements Mapping
--------------------

This design addresses:

* REQ_SAFETY_001: ASIL Context Maintenance (framework designed)
* ASIL Level: D preparation (not certified)
* Implementation Status: Infrastructure exists, safety mechanisms under development
