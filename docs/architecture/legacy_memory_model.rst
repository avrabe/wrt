Memory Model
============

WRT Memory Safety Architecture
-------------------------------

This document describes the memory model implementation for WRT, satisfying requirement REQ_MEM_001.

Key Features
------------

* Bounds checking for all memory operations
* No buffer overflow vulnerabilities
* ASIL-C compliance for memory safety
* Safe memory abstractions in wrt-foundation/src/safe_memory.rs

Implementation
--------------

The memory model ensures that all memory accesses are bounds-checked through:

1. **SafeMemory abstractions**: Wrapper types that enforce bounds checking
2. **Bounded collections**: Collections with compile-time or runtime size limits
3. **Memory validation**: All allocations verified before use

Verification
------------

Memory safety is verified through:

* Unit tests in wrt-foundation/tests/memory_tests_moved.rs
* ASIL-C tagged test cases
* Static analysis and formal verification

Safety Requirements
-------------------

This implementation satisfies:

* REQ_MEM_001: Memory Bounds Checking
* ASIL Level: C
* Verification Status: Complete
