Memory Model
============

.. warning::
   **Legacy Documentation**: This is legacy design documentation. The memory model 
   implementation is under development as part of the overall WebAssembly execution engine.

WRT Memory Safety Architecture Design
-------------------------------------

This document describes the intended memory model design for WRT.

Target Features
---------------

* Bounds checking for all memory operations (infrastructure designed)
* Buffer overflow prevention (framework in development)
* ASIL-C preparation for memory safety (not certified)
* Safe memory abstractions in wrt-foundation/src/safe_memory.rs (partial implementation)

Implementation Status
---------------------

The memory model design includes bounds-checking infrastructure through:

1. **SafeMemory abstractions**: Wrapper types designed for bounds checking (implemented)
2. **Bounded collections**: Collections with compile-time size limits (implemented)
3. **Memory validation**: Allocation verification framework (under development)

Verification Status
-------------------

Memory safety verification approach includes:

* Unit tests in wrt-foundation/tests/ (partial coverage)
* ASIL-C tagged test cases (framework exists)
* Static analysis integration (planned)

Requirements Mapping
--------------------

This design addresses:

* REQ_MEM_001: Memory Bounds Checking (infrastructure exists)
* ASIL Level: C preparation (not certified)
* Implementation Status: Infrastructure exists, execution engine in development
