# Next Steps

This document tracks the implementation tasks for the WRT project based on requirements and current status.

## Implementation Tasks

1. [~] **Complete i64 Comparison Implementation**
   - Current status: i64 comparison functions are implemented and tests are passing
   - Tasks:
     - [x] Implement basic i64 comparison functions
     - [x] Fix the i64 comparison test failures in `wrt/tests/wast_tests.rs` by adding proper implementations in stackless.rs
     - [x] Address unused variables warnings in the SIMD instruction handlers by prefixing them with underscores
     - [ ] Add proper documentation for all functions
     - [ ] Ensure instruction execution for i64 comparisons works in all execution modes
   - Test file: `wrt/tests/wast_tests.rs:test_i64_compare_operations`

2. [x] **Address Documentation Warnings**
   - [x] Add missing documentation for instruction variants in `wrt/src/instructions/mod.rs`
   - [x] Add missing documentation for methods in `wrt/src/stackless.rs`
   - [x] Follow project documentation standards as mentioned in README.md

3. [ ] **Clean Up Unused Code**
   - Address unused variables by either using them or prefixing with underscores
   - Remove or refactor dead code in `wrt/src/execution.rs` (e.g., `InstructionCategory` enum and unused methods)

4. [ ] **Focus on Component Model Implementation (REQ_014, REQ_021)**
   - Implement WebAssembly Component Model Preview 2 specification
   - Complete component model binary format parsing
   - Implement resource type handling
   - Implement interface types
   - Implement component instantiation and linking
   - Implement resource lifetime management
   - Add custom section handling

5. [ ] **Implement State Migration (REQ_004, REQ_008)**
   - Develop state serialization mechanism
   - Enable migration of execution state between machines
   - Support checkpoint/lock-step execution

6. [ ] **Implement WASI Logging Support (REQ_015, REQ_016)**
   - Complete WASI logging API implementation per specification
   - Add support for all defined log levels
   - Implement context-based logging
   - Add stderr integration
   - Ensure thread-safe logging operations
   - Add platform-specific backends:
     - Linux: syslog integration
     - macOS: Unified Logging System integration
     - Generic fallback for other platforms

7. [ ] **Improve Baremetal Support (REQ_002)**
   - Ensure the interpreter works in environments without an OS
   - Validate `no_std` compatibility across all components
   - Test on bare-metal hardware

8. [ ] **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Implement WAST test infrastructure
   - Add more tests for SIMD operations
   - Increase coverage for component model features
   - Add tests for state migration
