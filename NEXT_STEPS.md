# Next Steps

This document tracks the implementation tasks for the WRT project based on requirements and current status.

## Implementation Tasks

1. [x] **Complete i64 Comparison Implementation**
   - Current status: i64 comparison functions are implemented and verified with dedicated tests
   - Tasks:
     - [x] Implement basic i64 comparison functions
     - [x] Fix the i64 comparison test failures in `wrt/tests/wast_tests.rs` by adding proper implementations in stackless.rs
     - [x] Address unused variables warnings in the SIMD instruction handlers by prefixing them with underscores
     - [x] Add proper documentation for all functions
     - [x] Create dedicated test for i64 comparison operations
     - [x] Ensure instruction execution for i64 comparisons works correctly
   - Test files: 
     - `wrt/tests/i64_compare_test.rs:test_direct_i64_comparison`
     - (Note: Original test `wrt/tests/wast_tests.rs:test_i64_compare_operations` is not functioning due to module loader issues)

2. [x] **Address Documentation Warnings**
   - [x] Add missing documentation for instruction variants in `wrt/src/instructions/mod.rs`
   - [x] Add missing documentation for methods in `wrt/src/stackless.rs`
   - [x] Follow project documentation standards as mentioned in README.md

3. [x] **Clean Up Unused Code**
   - [x] Address unused variables by prefixing with underscores in control.rs, parametric.rs, table.rs, and stackless.rs
   - [x] Remove dead code in `wrt/src/execution.rs` (unused InstructionCategory enum and MAX_CALL_DEPTH constant)

4. [x] **Focus on Component Model Implementation (REQ_014, REQ_021)**
   - Current status: Component Model has been fully implemented with proper support for component instantiation, imports, exports, and linking between components.
   - Implementation plan:
     - [x] Fix type compatibility between component::InstanceType and types::InstanceType
     - [x] Add Clone implementations for ExternValue and related types
     - [x] Fix memory read operations to return Vec<u8> instead of &[u8]
     - [x] Fix the load_component_binary method to properly implement the binary format specification
     - [x] Enhance component instantiation to support proper linking
     - [x] Add support for component imports/exports with namespaces
   - Dependencies: This task builds upon the existing execution engine and module parsing
   - Test files: 
     - Comprehensive tests in `wrt/tests/component_tests.rs` including component linking tests
     - Resource and interface tests in their respective modules
     - All component tests are now passing

5. [ ] **Implement State Migration (REQ_004, REQ_008)**
   - Develop state serialization mechanism
   - Enable migration of execution state between machines
   - Support checkpoint/lock-step execution

6. [ ] **Implement WASI Logging Support (REQ_015, REQ_016)**
   - Complete WASI logging API implementation per specification
   - Add support for all defined log levels
   - Implement context-based logging
   - Add stderr integration
   - Ensure thread-safe logging operations
   - Add platform-specific backends:
     - Linux: syslog integration
     - macOS: Unified Logging System integration
     - Generic fallback for other platforms

7. [ ] **Improve Baremetal Support (REQ_002)**
   - Ensure the interpreter works in environments without an OS
   - Validate `no_std` compatibility across all components
   - Test on bare-metal hardware

8. [ ] **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Implement WAST test infrastructure
   - Add more tests for SIMD operations
   - Increase coverage for component model features
   - Add tests for state migration
