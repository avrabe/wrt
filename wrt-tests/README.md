# WRT Tests - Unified Test Workspace

This workspace provides a unified testing infrastructure for the WebAssembly Runtime (WRT) project.

## Structure

- `integration/` - Cross-crate integration tests
  - `component_model/` - Component model functionality tests
  - `runtime/` - Runtime system tests
  - `platform/` - Platform-specific tests
  - `no_std/` - No-std compatibility tests
  - `security/` - Security and CFI tests
- `benchmarks/` - Performance benchmarks
- `fixtures/` - Test assets (WAT, WASM files)
- `scripts/` - Test automation scripts

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
cargo test --manifest-path wrt-tests/Cargo.toml
```

### Specific Test Suite
```bash
cargo test --manifest-path wrt-tests/integration/Cargo.toml component_model_tests
```

### Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Component model tests
cargo test --manifest-path wrt-tests/integration/Cargo.toml component_model

# Runtime tests
cargo test --manifest-path wrt-tests/integration/Cargo.toml runtime

# Platform-specific tests
cargo test --manifest-path wrt-tests/integration/Cargo.toml platform
```

## Test Registry

The unified test registry (`wrt-test-registry`) provides:
- Consistent test runners across std/no_std environments
- Test discovery and coordination
- Standardized test reporting
- Feature-based test filtering

## Migration Status

- âœ… Enhanced test registry with unified coordination
- âœ… Created integration test structure
- âœ… Migrated control instructions tests
- âœ… Migrated CFI security tests
- ðŸ”„ Individual crate test standardization (in progress)

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Place integration tests in the appropriate `integration/` subdirectory
2. Use the unified test registry for consistency
3. Follow the naming convention: `*_tests.rs`
4. Add test fixtures to the `fixtures/` directory
5. Update this README when adding new test categories
