# Example Memory Budget Configuration
# 
# This file shows how to configure custom memory budgets for WRT crates.
# Copy this to memory_budget.toml to use custom budgets.
#
# Values can include unit suffixes: KB, MB, GB
# Without a suffix, values are interpreted as bytes.

# Foundation layer - core memory management
"wrt-foundation" = "8MB"

# Runtime layer - execution engine
"wrt-runtime" = "16MB"

# Component Model support
"wrt-component" = "12MB"

# WebAssembly decoding and parsing
"wrt-decoder" = "4MB"

# Format handling and WIT parsing
"wrt-format" = "2MB"

# Host environment integration
"wrt-host" = "4MB"

# Debug and development tools
"wrt-debug" = "2MB"

# Platform abstraction layer
"wrt-platform" = "8MB"

# Instruction execution
"wrt-instructions" = "4MB"

# Logging infrastructure
"wrt-logging" = "1MB"

# Interception and monitoring
"wrt-intercept" = "1MB"

# Panic handling
"wrt-panic" = "512KB"

# Synchronization primitives
"wrt-sync" = "1MB"

# Mathematical operations
"wrt-math" = "512KB"

# Error handling
"wrt-error" = "256KB"

# Helper utilities
"wrt-helper" = "256KB"

# Environment Variables:
# You can also override budgets using environment variables:
# export WRT_BUDGET_WRT_FOUNDATION=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
# export WRT_BUDGET_WRT_RUNTIME=33554432     # 32MB in bytes
