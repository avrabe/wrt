# PulseEngine (WRT Edition)

A pure Rust implementation of WebAssembly infrastructure designed for safety-critical systems. Provides foundational components for WebAssembly execution with emphasis on memory safety, deterministic behavior, and formal verification capabilities.

## Features

- **Memory Operations**: Complete WebAssembly memory management with bounds checking
- **Arithmetic Instructions**: Full implementation of WebAssembly numeric operations
- **Type System**: Complete WebAssembly value types and validation infrastructure
- **`no_std` Compatible**: Works in embedded and bare-metal environments
- **Safety-Critical Design**: ASIL compliance framework and formal verification support
- **Development Status**: Core execution engine and Component Model under development

## Quick Start

For comprehensive installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/source/getting_started/installation.rst).

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.86.0 or newer
- cargo-wrt (included in this repository)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/pulseengine/wrt
cd wrt

# Install cargo-wrt
cargo install --path cargo-wrt

# Build everything
cargo-wrt build

# Run tests
cargo-wrt test

# Run example (requires setup)
cargo-wrt wrtd --test
```

### Usage

**Note**: PulseEngine is currently available only as source code. Add it to your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
wrt = { path = "path/to/wrt" }  # Point to local clone
```

Basic usage:

```rust
use wrt::prelude::*;

// Note: Core execution engine under development
// Current example shows memory and arithmetic operations
let memory = WrtMemory::new(1024)?;
let value = Value::I32(42);
let result = ArithmeticOp::I32Add.execute(&[value, Value::I32(8)])?;
```
