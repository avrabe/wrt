# WebAssembly Runtime (WRT) Qualification Plan

## Overview

This qualification plan outlines the activities needed to implement a comprehensive qualification framework for the WebAssembly Runtime (WRT) project aligned with the Ferrocene qualification approach. The plan identifies which qualification materials are already in place, which need to be implemented, and how to integrate them within the existing codebase structure.

## Qualification Materials Assessment

Based on the Ferrocene qualification materials (https://public-docs.ferrocene.dev/main/index.html), we've assessed our current implementation status:

| Qualification Material       | Status      | Location/Implementation Plan                    |
|------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Evaluation Plan              | Partial     | Defined in docs/source/requirements.rst        |
| Evaluation Report            | Not Started | To be implemented                              |
| Qualification Plan           | Started     | This document (qualification.plan)             |
| Qualification Report         | Not Started | To be implemented                              |
| Traceability Matrix          | Partial     | Partially in docs/source/requirements.rst      |
| Document List                | Not Started | To be implemented                              |
| Internal Procedures          | Partial     | Partially in justfile                          |
| Technical Report             | Not Started | To be implemented                              |
| Ferrocene Requirements       | Partial     | Defined in docs/source/requirements.rst        |

## Integration with Existing Tools

### xtask Integration
The qualification process will be integrated with the existing xtask framework:

- Add new xtask commands for qualification activities:
  ```rust
  // In xtask/src/main.rs
  fn qualification_commands() -> Command {
      Command::new("qualification")
          .about("Qualification-related commands")
          .subcommand(generate_traceability_matrix())
          .subcommand(run_safety_analysis())
          .subcommand(generate_qualification_report())
  }
  ```

- Implement traceability matrix generation:
  ```rust
  // In xtask/src/main.rs or a new file xtask/src/qualification.rs
  fn generate_traceability_matrix() -> Command {
      Command::new("traceability")
          .about("Generate traceability matrix from requirements")
          .action(|_args| {
              // Implementation to extract requirements and tests
              // and generate a traceability matrix
          })
  }
  ```

### justfile Integration
Add qualification-specific recipes to the justfile:

```makefile
# Generate qualification documentation
qualification-docs: docs-common
    # Generate traceability matrix
    cargo xtask qualification traceability
    # Build qualification documentation
    {{sphinx_build}} -M html "{{sphinx_source}}" "{{sphinx_build_dir}}" {{sphinx_opts}}

# Run qualification assessment
qualification-assessment:
    cargo xtask qualification assess
    # Report qualification status
    cargo xtask qualification report-status
```

## Implementation Schedule

   - Implement xtask qualification commands
   - Add justfile recipes

2. **Phase 2: Traceability Implementation**
   - Complete requirements documentation
   - Implement traceability matrix generation
   - Link requirements to test cases

3. **Phase 3: Safety Analysis**
   - Perform hazard analysis
   - Document safety requirements
   - Implement safety validation tests

4. **Phase 4: Qualification Evidence**
   - Generate qualification reports
   - Document test coverage results
   - Prepare final qualification package

## Crate-Specific Qualification Activities

Each crate in the WRT ecosystem requires specific qualification activities:

- **wrt-runtime**: Core functionality qualification
  - MCDC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage) testing
  - Formal verification of critical algorithms
  - Performance bounds validation

- **wrt-types**: Type system qualification
  - Exhaustive type validation testing
  - Boundary condition analysis
  - Formal verification of type conversions

- **wrt-component**: Component model qualification
  - Component model specification compliance testing
  - Resource lifetime validation
  - Interface mapping verification

- **wrtd**: Command-line interface qualification
  - Input validation testing
  - Error handling verification
  - Performance validation

## Conclusion

This qualification plan provides a roadmap for implementing the necessary qualification materials to achieve certification alignment with standards like ISO-26262 and IEC-61508. By following this plan, we will systematically extend our existing documentation and testing infrastructure to support formal qualification activities.
