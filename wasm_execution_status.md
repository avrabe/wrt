# WASM Execution Status Report

## What We Fixed

1. **String Type Conversion in component/instantiate.rs**
   - ✅ Fixed line 324: Convert `export.name` from String to ComponentString
   - ✅ Updated LinkingError enum to use ComponentString
   - ✅ Added proper memory provider for string conversions
   - Result: Reduced errors from 92 to 88

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- WASM file loading and validation
- Module structure parsing  
- Simulated execution (counts fuel, validates structure)
- Basic wrtd with QM level features

### Not Working ❌
- Actual WASM instruction execution
- Function calls with real computations
- Memory read/write operations
- Return values from WASM functions

## Why Actual Execution Doesn't Work

The `wrt-execution` feature is required for real WASM execution, but it depends on wrt-runtime which has 88 remaining compilation errors:

1. **Missing imports** (Vec, std::iter, etc.) in no_std contexts
2. **Generic type parameters** missing on type aliases
3. **Trait implementations** missing for HashMap value types
4. **Module conversion issues** between wrt-format and wrt-runtime types

## To Enable Actual Execution

### Short Term (Quick Fix)
Not feasible - requires fixing all 88 errors across multiple files in wrt-runtime.

### Proper Solution
1. Complete the memory unification work in wrt-runtime
2. Add missing trait implementations for all types used in HashMaps
3. Fix std/no_std conditional compilation issues
4. Ensure all type aliases have proper generic parameters

## Current Execution Flow

```
wrtd module.wasm
  ↓
✅ Load file
  ↓
✅ Validate WASM header
  ↓
✅ Parse sections
  ↓
✅ Count fuel
  ↓
❌ Execute instructions (requires wrt-execution)
  ↓
✅ Report success (simulated)
```

## Demonstration

To see the difference:
- Current: `./target/release/wrtd test_memory.wasm` → Shows "Simulating execution"
- With fixes: Would show actual computation results

The fundamental issue is that the memory system unification broke the component instantiation code, which blocks the entire execution pipeline.
