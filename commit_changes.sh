git commit -m "fix(wrt-runtime): resolve compilation errors in stackless execution engine

This commit addresses multiple compilation issues in the wrt-runtime crate
that were preventing successful builds:

- Fix BoundedVec type mismatches in stackless/frame.rs by using proper
  ValueStackVec type aliases for both std and no_std configurations
- Unify memory provider types by replacing hardcoded NoStdProvider<131072>
  with the RuntimeProvider from bounded_runtime_infra across multiple files
- Correct field name references from wrt_module.start_func to wrt_module.start
  to match the actual Module struct definition
- Implement chunked memory copy solution for BoundedVec compatibility,
  replacing unsupported as_mut_slice() method calls
- Make create_runtime_provider() function public in bounded_runtime_infra
  to support unified memory allocation patterns

These changes ensure the runtime compiles successfully while maintaining
compatibility with the capability-based memory management system and
supporting both std and no_std environments.

Files modified:
- wrt-runtime/src/stackless/frame.rs: BoundedVec type fixes, memory copy solution
- wrt-runtime/src/bounded_runtime_infra.rs: Public create_runtime_provider
- wrt-runtime/src/module.rs: Field name corrections, provider unification
- wrt-runtime/src/component/instantiate.rs: Provider type updates
- wrt-runtime/src/stackless/tail_call.rs: RuntimeProvider usage
- wrt-runtime/src/module_instance.rs: Unified provider types
- wrt-runtime/src/engine/capability_engine.rs: Provider consolidation
- wrt-runtime/src/atomic_memory_model.rs: RuntimeProvider migration
- wrt-runtime/src/instruction_parser.rs: Provider type fixes
- wrt-runtime/src/component_impl.rs: BoundedStack provider update"

# Commit 2: Export section parsing fix
git add wrt-decoder/src/streaming_decoder.rs

git commit -m "fix(wrt-decoder): implement missing export section parsing

The streaming decoder had an empty process_export_section implementation
that was causing WebAssembly modules to report 0 exports even when they
contained valid export sections in the binary format.

This fix implements proper export section parsing by:
- Reading export count from section data using LEB128 decoding
- Parsing each export entry including name, kind (function/table/memory/global), and index
- Adding parsed exports to the module's export collection
- Supporting all standard WebAssembly export kinds per the specification

The implementation follows the WebAssembly binary format specification
for export sections (section ID 7) and ensures that exported functions
like 'add' in test_add.wasm are correctly detected and made available
for runtime execution.

This resolves the critical issue where test_add.wasm reported 0 exports
despite containing a valid export section with the 'add' function export."

git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive WebAssembly execution tests and demonstrations

This commit adds a complete test suite to verify that WebAssembly execution
is working correctly after the runtime compilation and export parsing fixes:

Test Files Added:
- test_wasm_execution.rs: Standalone script for end-to-end testing
- examples/test_add_execution.rs: Example showing complete execution flow
- test_wrtd_execution.sh: Shell script for testing wrtd configurations
- wrt-tests/integration/test_add_execution.rs: Integration test for test suite
- demonstrate_wasm_execution.rs: Comprehensive demonstration of all fixes

Test Coverage:
- Export parsing verification (confirms exports are now detected)
- Runtime compilation validation (all type mismatches resolved)
- Execution mode testing (actual execution vs simulation mode)
- Function execution verification (add(5,3) = 8 calculation)
- Multi-configuration testing (QM, ASIL-B levels)

These tests provide confidence that the WebAssembly runtime can successfully:
1. Load WebAssembly modules from binary format
2. Parse and detect exported functions
3. Instantiate modules in the execution engine
4. Execute exported functions with correct results
5. Support different safety levels and configurations

The test suite serves as both validation and documentation of the
fixed WebAssembly execution capabilities."
