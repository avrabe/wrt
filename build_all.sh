echo "Phase 4: Implement No_Std Support - Completed"
echo ""
echo "Implemented features:"
echo "1. Added SafeStack implementation in wrt-types/src/safe_memory.rs"
echo "2. Added SafeMemoryHandler for more comprehensive memory safety"
echo "3. Updated wrt/src/stack.rs to use SafeStack instead of Vec"
echo "4. Created configuration examples for both std and no_std"
echo "5. Added proper no_std support with conditional compilation"
echo "6. Added documentation for using safe memory structures"
echo ""
echo "The implementation provides:"
echo "- Memory safety with checksums and integrity verification"
echo "- No_std compatibility with proper feature flags"
echo "- Optimized performance with configurable verification levels"
echo "- Documentation and examples for migration from Vec to SafeStack"
echo ""
echo "To enable safety features, use:"

echo "To enable no_std support, use:"
echo "  cargo build --no-default-features --features \"no_std,alloc\""
