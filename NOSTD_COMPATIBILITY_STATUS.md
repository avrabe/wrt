# No-Std Compatibility Status

## Summary

The WRT codebase has been updated to support three configurations:
- **std**: Full standard library support
- **no_std + alloc**: No standard library but with allocation
- **pure no_std**: No standard library and no allocation

## Current Status

### ✅ Fully Compatible Crates

These crates build and test successfully in all three configurations:

- **wrt-error**: Complete no_std support with proper error handling
- **wrt-math**: Pure computation, no allocations needed
- **wrt-sync**: Synchronization primitives with conditional compilation
- **wrt-foundation**: Core types with bounded collections for no_std
- **wrt-intercept**: Simple interceptor patterns

### ⚠️ Partial Support

These crates have some configuration support but not all:

- **wrt-platform**: Works in pure no_std, but has cyclic dependency issues with alloc/std
- **wrt-logging**: Works with alloc/std, needs fixes for pure no_std
- **wrt-host**: Works with alloc/std, pure no_std needs more work on collections
- **wrt-instructions**: Works with alloc, needs fixes for pure no_std and std

### ❌ Needs Major Work

These crates need significant refactoring:

- **wrt-format**: ResourceEntry traits missing, generic parameter issues
- **wrt-decoder**: Depends on wrt-format
- **wrt-runtime**: Depends on multiple crates with issues
- **wrt-component**: Depends on multiple crates with issues
- **wrt**: Top-level crate depends on all others

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Prelude Updates

Updated prelude.rs files across crates to properly handle all three configurations:

```rust
// For std
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
pub use std::{collections::{HashMap, HashSet}, vec::Vec, string::String};

// For no_std + alloc
#[cfg(all(not(feature = "std"), feature = "alloc"))]
pub use alloc::{collections::{BTreeMap as HashMap, BTreeSet as HashSet}, vec::Vec, string::String};

// For pure no_std
#[cfg(all(not(feature = "std"), not(feature = "alloc")))]
pub use wrt_foundation::{
    bounded::{BoundedVec as Vec, BoundedString as String},
    BoundedMap as HashMap,
    BoundedSet as HashSet,
};
```

### 2. Conditional Compilation

Added proper feature gates for struct fields and methods that require allocation:

```rust
#[cfg(any(feature = "std", feature = "alloc"))]
interceptor: Option<Arc<dyn BuiltinInterceptor>>,
```

### 3. Generic Parameters

Fixed generic parameter issues for bounded collections in no_std:

```rust
// Before
required_builtins: HashSet<BuiltinType>,

// After (for no_std)
required_builtins: HashSet<BuiltinType, 32, wrt_foundation::NoStdProvider<1024>>,
```

### 4. Import Fixes

Added missing trait imports like `BoundedCapacity` and proper paths for `NoStdMemoryProvider`.

### 5. Cyclic Dependency Resolution

Temporarily disabled the cyclic dependency between wrt-foundation and wrt-platform to allow builds.

## Remaining Issues

1. **wrt-format**: Need to implement missing traits (Checksummable, ToBytes, FromBytes) for ResourceEntry
2. **Type bounds**: Many types need proper bounds for no_std compatibility
3. **Tests**: Need to update tests to work in all configurations
4. **Documentation**: Update docs to explain no_std usage patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Fix wrt-format first**: It's a dependency for many other crates
2. **Use type aliases**: Define configuration-specific type aliases to simplify code
3. **Test incrementally**: Fix one crate at a time and verify all configurations
4. **Update CI**: Add no_std verification to CI pipeline
5. **Document patterns**: Create a guide for no_std development patterns in WRT
