# WebAssembly Instruction Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing Option 3: Clear Separation of Concerns for WebAssembly instructions in the WRT project. This approach maintains both the `wrt-instructions` crate and the `wrt/src/instructions` module but with clearly defined responsibilities and reduced duplication.

## Goals

- Create a clear separation of concerns between `wrt-instructions` and `wrt/src/instructions`
- Eliminate duplication in instruction implementations
- Prepare the codebase for ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation
- Ensure compatibility with both `std` and `no_std` environments
- Fix all clippy warnings, build errors, and build warnings
- Maintain test coverage and code quality

## Validation Criteria

Each step in this plan includes validation criteria. All crates modified during a step should pass these checks before proceeding to the next step:

1. **Build Validation**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --all-targets --features std
   cargo build --all-targets --no-default-features --features no_std
   ```

2. **Clippy Validation**:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy --all-targets --features std -- -D warnings
   cargo clippy --all-targets --no-default-features --features no_std -- -D warnings
   ```

3. **Test Validation**:
   ```bash
   cargo test --all-targets --features std
   ```

4. **Code Coverage Validation**:
   ```bash
   cargo llvm-cov --all-targets --features std
   ```

The final validation for the `wrt` crate is only required at the end of the implementation process.

## Implementation Steps

- ✅ The adapters properly translate between runtime-specific contexts and pure instruction implementations
- ❌ There are still test failures in the `wrt-instructions` crate related to missing trait implementations
- ❌ Build errors in the `wrt` crate need to be resolved in future steps

**Note:** While the architectural refactoring for module-specific files has been completed, with proper delegation to pure implementations, there are still build errors and test failures that need to be addressed in future steps. These issues are primarily related to missing trait implementations and compatibility between different crates' type definitions.
