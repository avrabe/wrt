  - Propagation boundary enforcement
  - Divergence tracking
- **Key Proof**: `verify_fault_propagation_prevention`
  - Demonstrates fault containment
  - Validates detection mechanisms

## Integration with Test Framework

### Test Registry Integration
All 6 advanced proofs are registered with the WRT TestRegistry, allowing them to:
- Run as traditional tests when KANI is not available
- Execute as formal proofs under KANI verification
- Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines

### Module Updates
- Updated `mod.rs` to include `advanced_proofs` module
- Added `register_advanced_tests()` method to `KaniTestRunner`
- Integrated with `run_all_proofs()` for comprehensive verification

## Safety Properties Verified

1. **Synchronization Invariants**: Lock-step units maintain identical state
2. **Fault Tolerance**: System continues correct operation with single failures
3. **Algorithmic Consistency**: Diverse implementations produce identical results
4. **Error Containment**: Hardware errors are detected and don't corrupt system state
5. **Control Flow Security**: Execution follows expected paths
6. **Fault Isolation**: Errors in one component don't cascade

## ASIL-D Compliance Features

The advanced proofs specifically address ASIL-D requirements:

1. **Redundancy**: Multiple verification approaches for critical properties
2. **Diversity**: Different algorithms verify same properties
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of system health metrics
4. **Fault Detection**: Multiple layers of error detection
5. **Containment**: Proven fault isolation boundaries

## Usage

```

### Integration with CI

The advanced proofs are automatically included in:
- KANI verification workflows
- ASIL-D compliance verification
- Safety-critical test suites

## Metrics

- **Total Proofs**: 6 advanced verification properties
- **Code Coverage**: Covers lock-step, TMR, diversity, EDC, CFI, and fault containment
- **ASIL Level**: Designed for ASIL-D compliance
- **Verification Time**: Optimized for CI integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
1. N-version programming verification
2. Byzantine fault tolerance proofs
3. Timing attack resistance verification
4. Side-channel resistance proofs
5. Quantum-safe cryptography verification

## Conclusion

The advanced KANI proofs provide a robust foundation for ASIL-D compliance verification in the WRT runtime. These proofs demonstrate that the system can maintain safety properties even in the presence of hardware faults, systematic errors, and malicious attacks.
