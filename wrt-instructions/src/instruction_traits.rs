//! Traits for WebAssembly instruction implementation.
//!
//! This module provides traits that define the interfaces for pure instruction implementations.
//! These traits establish a clear boundary between instruction implementations and runtime details.

/// Trait for pure instruction execution.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for executing a pure instruction with a given context.
/// The context type is generic, allowing different execution engines to provide their own context.
pub trait PureInstruction<T, E> {
    /// Executes the instruction with the given context.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `context` - The execution context
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(())` - If the instruction executed successfully
    /// * `Err(E)` - If an error occurred during execution
    fn execute(&self, context: &mut T) -> core::result::Result<(), E>;
}

/// Trait for pure memory instructions.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for executing a pure memory instruction with a given memory.
/// The memory type is generic, allowing different execution engines to provide their own memory.
pub trait PureMemoryInstruction<T, E> {
    /// Executes the memory instruction with the given memory.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `memory` - The memory to operate on
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(())` - If the instruction executed successfully
    /// * `Err(E)` - If an error occurred during execution
