# No_std Compatibility Fixes

This document summarizes the issues found and fixes made to improve no_std compatibility across the WRT codebase.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Feature Flag Issues

- **wrt-component**: 
  - Changed default features from `std` to empty for better no_std compatibility
  - Updated `no_std` feature to be a no-op since the crate is already no_std by default

- **wrt-runtime**:
  - Updated `no_std` feature to be a no-op instead of propagating non-existent features
  - Added missing `safe-memory` feature

- **wrt-decoder**:
  - Removed compile-time error that prevented using the crate in pure no_std mode
  - Updated `no_std` feature to be a no-op for consistency

- **wrt-logging**:
  - Updated `no_std` feature to be a no-op for consistency

- **wrt-format**:
  - Added missing `safe-memory` feature to fix dependency resolution

### 2. Verification Script Updates

- Updated `verify_no_std.sh` to correctly handle crates that are no_std by default
- Fixed configuration detection to properly test pure no_std, no_std with alloc, and std configurations

## Verified Components

Confirmed proper no_std support in:

1. `wrt-error`: Already fully no_std compatible
2. `wrt-math`: No issues found
3. `wrt-sync`: Properly handles std/no_std/alloc configurations
4. `wrt-types`: Uses bounded collections for no_std environments
5. `wrt-platform`: Properly handles platform-specific code

## Partially Supported Components

Some crates have partial no_std support with certain limitations:

1. `wrt-decoder`: 
   - Most functionality works in no_std
   - Some advanced parsing features require alloc

2. `wrt-runtime`: 
   - Core functionality works in no_std
   - Component model and some advanced features require alloc

3. `wrt-component`: 
   - Basic functionality works in no_std
   - Most component model features require alloc

4. `wrt-logging`: 
   - Basic logging mechanisms work in no_std
   - String formatting and advanced features require alloc

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Conditional Imports**: All crates use proper `#[cfg]` attributes for conditional imports
2. **Prelude Modules**: All crates have well-structured prelude.rs files that handle different configurations
3. **Feature Gates**: Dependencies are properly feature-gated to avoid pulling in unwanted features
4. **Error Handling**: Confirmed that public APIs use Result instead of unwrap/expect

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. Ensure new crates follow the established pattern:
   - Default features should be empty (pure no_std)
   - `std` feature should enable standard library support
   - `alloc` feature should enable allocator support without std

2. Add more comprehensive tests for no_std environments:
   - Create specific test cases for pure no_std
   - Test resource allocation patterns in no_std with alloc

3. Consider adding explicit support level indicators in crate documentation:
   - Fully supported in pure no_std
   - Requires alloc but works without std
   - Requires std
