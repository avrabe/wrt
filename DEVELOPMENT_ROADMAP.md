# WRT Development Roadmap

## Current Status âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETE

The WRT project has achieved significant milestones:

âœ… **Completed Major Work:**
- Safety verification framework (SCORE-inspired) with CI integration
- Agent unification (4 agents â†’ 1 unified agent)
- Requirements traceability system (`requirements.toml`)
- Comprehensive documentation and testing frameworks
- Multi-standard safety system (ISO 26262, DO-178C, etc.)
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, QNX, Zephyr)

## Remaining Work

### ðŸ”¥ **Priority 1: Final Compilation Fix**

**Issue**: Single remaining compilation error:
```
error[E0152]: found duplicate lang item `panic_impl`
```

**Location**: `wrt-platform` crate
**Fix**: Remove duplicate panic handler in no_std builds

**Action**: 
```rust
// In wrt-platform/src/lib.rs - ensure only one panic handler
#[cfg(all(not(feature = "std"), not(test)))]
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Priority 2: Advanced Safety Features** 

**Missing ASIL Test Macros** (from SCORE Phase 4):
```rust
// Implement in wrt-foundation/src/asil_testing.rs
#[asil_test(level = "AsilD", requirement = "REQ_MEM_001")]
fn test_memory_bounds_critical() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

**Formal Verification Integration** (from SCORE Phase 4):
- Integrate Kani verification for critical paths
- Add formal verification to CI pipeline
- Document verification coverage

### ðŸ“š **Priority 3: Documentation & Deployment**

**Production Deployment Guide**:
- Safety-critical deployment procedures
- Certification artifact generation
- Multi-platform deployment instructions

**Performance Validation**:
- Cross-crate performance benchmarks
- Safety overhead measurements
- Optimization recommendations

## Implementation Timeline

### **Week 1**: Critical Fixes
- [ ] Fix duplicate panic handler (1 day)
- [ ] Final compilation validation (1 day)
- [ ] Integration test suite (3 days)

### **Week 2-3**: Advanced Features  
- [ ] ASIL test macro implementation (1 week)
- [ ] Formal verification integration (1 week)

### **Week 4**: Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Production deployment guide (3 days)
- [ ] Performance validation suite (2 days)

## Success Criteria

**Ready for Production Release**:
- âœ… All crates compile without errors or warnings
- âœ… Full test suite passes (unit, integration, ASIL-tagged)
- âœ… CI pipeline includes safety verification with gates
- âœ… Documentation covers all major use cases
- âœ… Performance benchmarks meet targets

## Architecture Notes

**Type System**: Successfully unified around `wrt-foundation` with consistent bounded collections and memory providers across all crates.

**Safety System**: Multi-standard safety context supporting automotive (ISO 26262), aerospace (DO-178C), industrial (IEC 61508), medical (IEC 62304), railway (EN 50128), and agricultural (ISO 25119) standards.

**Execution Model**: Unified execution agent supporting Component Model, async, stackless, and CFI-protected execution modes.

**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ 95% Complete - Production ready after final compilation fix and advanced feature implementation.
