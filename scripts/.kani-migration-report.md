# KANI Migration Verification Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the migration from legacy KANI tests to the modern formal verification infrastructure.

## Migration Status

### Legacy Test Coverage

The following legacy KANI tests have been analyzed for modern equivalents:

| Legacy Test | Modern Equivalent | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| verify_mutex_new_lock_unlock | kani_verify_mutex_mutual_exclusion | COVERED |
| verify_mutex_guard_deref | kani_verify_mutex_mutual_exclusion | COVERED |
| verify_mutex_guard_deref_mut | kani_verify_mutex_mutual_exclusion | COVERED |
| verify_rwlock_new_write_read | kani_verify_rwlock_concurrent_reads | COVERED |
| verify_rwlock_new_read_read | kani_verify_rwlock_concurrent_reads | COVERED |
| verify_rwlock_read_guard_deref | kani_verify_rwlock_concurrent_reads | COVERED |
| verify_rwlock_write_guard_derefmut | kani_verify_rwlock_concurrent_reads | COVERED |
| verify_rwlock_write_unlocks_for_read | kani_verify_rwlock_concurrent_reads | COVERED |
| verify_rwlock_read_unlocks_for_write | kani_verify_rwlock_concurrent_reads | COVERED |

### Infrastructure Comparison

- **Legacy Files**: Found in individual crates with #[kani::proof] annotations
- **Modern Infrastructure**: Centralized in wrt-tests/integration/formal_verification/
- **Workspace Integration**: Comprehensive metadata configuration in root Cargo.toml

### Recommendations

1. **Complete Migration**: Ensure all legacy test scenarios are covered by modern harnesses
2. **Legacy Cleanup**: Consider removing legacy test files after verification
3. **Documentation Update**: Update developer guides to reference modern infrastructure
4. **CI Integration**: Ensure modern formal verification runs in CI pipeline

### Next Steps

1. Address any missing coverage identified in this report
2. Run comprehensive formal verification: `./scripts/kani-verify.sh --profile asil-c`
3. Update documentation to reflect migration completion
4. Consider removing legacy test files after successful migration verification
