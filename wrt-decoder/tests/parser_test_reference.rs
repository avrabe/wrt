//\! Parser test reference for wrt-decoder
//\!
//\! Parser tests for wrt-decoder have been consolidated into wrt-tests/integration/parser/
//\! This eliminates duplication and provides comprehensive testing in a single location.
//\!
//\! To run parser tests:
//\! ```
//\! cargo test -p wrt-tests parser
//\! ```
//\!
//\! Original test file: parser_comprehensive_tests.rs
