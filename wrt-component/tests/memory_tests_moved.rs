//! Component Memory Optimization Tests - MOVED
//!
//! The memory optimization tests for wrt-component have been consolidated into
//! the main test suite at: wrt-tests/integration/memory/
//!
//! For the complete memory safety test suite, use:
//! ```
//! cargo test -p wrt-tests memory
//! ```
//!
//! Previously, component memory tests were in:
//! - wrt-component/tests/memory_optimization_tests.rs (MOVED)
//!
//! All functionality is now available in the consolidated test suite.
