# WebAssembly Component Model Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of the WebAssembly Component Model in wrt-component.

## Build Configuration Requirements

All features must work correctly in three configurations:
- ✅ `std` (standard library)
- ⚠️ `no_std + alloc` (no standard library, with allocator)
- ❌ `no_std` (pure no_std, no allocator)

Requirements for each configuration:
- Zero compilation errors
- Zero compilation warnings
- Zero clippy errors
- Zero clippy warnings
