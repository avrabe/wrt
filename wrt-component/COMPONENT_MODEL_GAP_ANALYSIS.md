# WebAssembly Component Model MVP Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

After a deep analysis of the WebAssembly Component Model MVP specification against our implementation, I've identified several gaps that need to be addressed for full compliance. While our implementation covers many core features, there are significant missing components, particularly around async support, WIT integration, and some advanced type system features.

## Detailed Gap Analysis

### 1. ✅ Implemented Core Features

#### Type System
- ✅ All primitive types (bool, s8-s64, u8-u64, f32, f64)
- ✅ String type with multiple encodings
- ✅ List, Record, Tuple, Variant, Enum, Option, Result, Flags
- ✅ Resource handles (own, borrow)
- ✅ Basic type lifting/lowering in Canonical ABI

#### Component Structure
- ✅ Component type definitions
- ✅ Import/export mechanisms
- ✅ Component instantiation
- ✅ Memory and table management
- ✅ Cross-component function calls
- ✅ Host integration

#### Binary Format Support
- ✅ Basic component parsing
- ✅ Section validation
- ✅ Type section handling
- ✅ Import/export section handling

### 2. ❌ Missing Features That Need Implementation

#### Async Support (Critical Gap)
- ❌ `stream<T>` type not implemented
- ❌ `future<T>` type not implemented  
- ❌ `error-context` type not implemented
- ❌ Async canonical built-ins missing:
  - `stream.new`
  - `stream.read` 
  - `stream.write`
  - `stream.cancel-read`
  - `stream.cancel-write`
  - `stream.close-readable`
  - `stream.close-writable`
  - `future.new`
  - `future.read`
  - `future.write`
  - `future.cancel-read`
  - `future.cancel-write`
  - `future.close-readable`
  - `future.close-writable`
  - `error-context.new`
  - `error-context.debug-string`
  - `error-context.drop`

#### Task Management (Critical Gap)
- ❌ Task creation and lifecycle management
- ❌ `task.return` built-in
- ❌ `task.wait` built-in
- ❌ `task.poll` built-in
- ❌ `task.cancel` built-in
- ❌ `task.yield` built-in
- ❌ `task.backpressure` built-in
- ❌ Subtask tracking
- ❌ Task-local storage

#### Advanced Canonical Built-ins
- ❌ `resource.new` with async support
- ❌ `resource.drop` with async cleanup
- ❌ `resource.rep` for handle representation
- ❌ Thread management built-ins
- ❌ `thread.spawn`
- ❌ `thread.hw-concurrency`

#### Type System Gaps
- ❌ Generative resource types (each instantiation creates new type)
- ❌ Type imports with bounds (`eq` and `sub`)
- ❌ Abstract type handling
- ❌ Type substitution during instantiation
- ❌ Subtyping for instance types

#### Binary Format Gaps
- ❌ Nested component support
- ❌ Component type section encoding
- ❌ Alias section handling
- ❌ Start function section
- ❌ Custom section preservation

#### WIT Integration (Major Gap)
- ❌ WIT parser not implemented
- ❌ WIT-to-component-type conversion
- ❌ Interface resolution
- ❌ World instantiation from WIT
- ❌ Package management
- ❌ Version handling
- ❌ Feature gates (@since, @unstable, @deprecated)

#### Advanced Features
- ❌ Component-to-component adapter generation
- ❌ Virtualization support
- ❌ Post-return cleanup functions
- ❌ Realloc function handling in canonical options
- ❌ Component composition/linking at runtime

### 3. 🔧 Features Needing Enhancement

#### Canonical ABI Enhancements
- 🔧 Async lifting/lowering support
- 🔧 Proper memory allocation with realloc
- 🔧 Post-return function support
- 🔧 Stream and future value handling
- 🔧 Error context propagation

#### Resource Management Enhancements
- 🔧 Async resource cleanup
- 🔧 Resource type generation per instance
- 🔧 Handle representation access
- 🔧 Cross-component resource sharing with async

#### Type System Enhancements
- 🔧 Full subtyping implementation
- 🔧 Type equality checking
- 🔧 Abstract type instantiation
- 🔧 Generative type tracking

## Implementation Plan for Full Compliance

### Phase 1: Type System Completion
1. Implement generative resource types
2. Add type import bounds (eq/sub)
3. Implement full subtyping rules
4. Add type substitution mechanism

### Phase 2: Async Foundation
1. Implement stream<T> and future<T> types
2. Add error-context type
3. Create async canonical built-ins
4. Implement task management system
5. Add async lifting/lowering

### Phase 3: WIT Support
1. Implement WIT parser
2. Add WIT-to-component type conversion
3. Implement interface and world handling
4. Add package management
5. Support feature gates

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Complete binary format support
2. Add component composition
3. Implement virtualization
4. Add thread management
5. Complete all canonical built-ins

## Cross-Environment Considerations

### std Environment
- Full async support with std::future integration
- Thread management using std::thread
- Complete WIT parser with file I/O

### no_std + alloc Environment  
- Custom async runtime implementation
- Bounded task queues
- Memory-only WIT handling
- Custom thread abstraction

### Pure no_std Environment
- Limited async support (poll-based)
- Fixed-size task pools
- Pre-compiled WIT support only
- Single-threaded operation only

## Required New Modules

1. **async_types.rs**: Stream, Future, ErrorContext types
2. **task_manager.rs**: Task lifecycle and management
3. **async_canonical.rs**: Async canonical built-ins
4. **wit_parser.rs**: WIT parsing and conversion
5. **type_bounds.rs**: Type import bounds handling
6. **component_composition.rs**: Runtime component linking
7. **thread_manager.rs**: Thread management for components
8. **virtualization.rs**: Component virtualization support

## Conclusion

While our current implementation provides a solid foundation with core type system support, component instantiation, and cross-component calls, achieving full MVP compliance requires significant additions, particularly in async support, WIT integration, and advanced type system features. The implementation plan above provides a roadmap to systematically address these gaps while maintaining cross-environment compatibility.
