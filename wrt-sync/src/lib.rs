/// Synchronization primitives for Wasmtime, supporting both std and `no_std`
/// environments.
///
/// This module provides essential synchronization tools like `WrtMutex` and
/// `WrtRwLock`, designed to work seamlessly in WebAssembly runtimes. They are
/// optimized for performance and safety, offering robust solutions for managing
/// concurrent access to shared resources.
///
/// ## Modules
///
/// - `mutex`: Provides `WrtMutex` and `WrtMutexGuard`.
/// - `rwlock`: Provides `WrtRwLock` and `WrtParkingRwLock`.
///
/// Each module is designed with an emphasis on ergonomics, performance, and
/// safety, offering robust solutions for managing concurrent access to shared
/// resources. The `WrtMutex` provides a mutual exclusion primitive.
/// It ensures that only one thread or task can access the protected data at any
/// given time. This implementation is designed for WebAssembly runtimes and
/// transparently adapts to both standard library and `no_std` environments
/// based on feature flags.
///
/// # Features
pub mod mutex;

/// OnceCell implementation for one-time initialization.
///
/// This module provides a synchronization primitive that allows for safe,
/// one-time initialization of a value.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use wrt_sync::prelude::*;
/// static SOME_STATIC: WrtOnce<Vec<i32>> = WrtOnce::new();
/// fn main() {
///     let data = SOME_STATIC.get_or_init(|| vec![1,2,3]);
///     assert_eq!(data, &vec![1,2,3]);
/// }
/// ```
pub mod once;

/// Prelude module for `wrt_sync`.

/// This module re-exports commonly used items for convenience.

/// WebAssembly and adjusts its behavior for `std` and `no_std` contexts.
