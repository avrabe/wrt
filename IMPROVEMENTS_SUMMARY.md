# WebAssembly Runtime Improvements Summary

## no_std Compatibility for wrt-component

### Completed Work

- Added pure no_std compatibility to the wrt-component crate
- Created a dedicated `no_alloc.rs` module with minimal WebAssembly Component Model functionality
- Implemented essential types like `ComponentSectionId`, `ComponentHeader`, and `MinimalComponent`
- Added validation functions with configurable verification levels
- Created comprehensive tests for pure no_std, no_std+alloc, and std environments
- Updated lib.rs to properly expose no_alloc module with appropriate feature gating

### Implementation Details

- Designed for progressive feature degradation across environments:
  - std: Full functionality
  - no_std+alloc: Full no_std functionality
  - no_std without alloc: Limited to validation and introspection
- Used bounded collections and SafeSlice from wrt-foundation for memory safety
- Integrated with wrt-decoder's no_alloc implementation for consistency
- Implemented validation with different levels (Basic, Standard, Full)

### Outstanding Issues

- Deep-rooted wrt-foundation dependency challenges:
  - Inconsistent feature flags and cfg attributes
  - Configuration issues with constants like MAX_WASM_NAME_LENGTH
  - Syntax errors in prelude.rs with cfg attributes
  - Incompatible dependencies on std/alloc in multiple modules
- Resource management needs no_std alternatives
- Error handling should be improved for no_std environments

### Next Steps

1. Fix wrt-foundation issues (MAX_WASM_NAME_LENGTH, prelude.rs)
2. Implement no_std compatible resource management
3. Fix error handling for memory-constrained environments
4. Expand test coverage for all environments
5. Verify with the no_std validation script

## Resource Management

## Type System

- Implemented bounded collections for better memory safety
- Enhanced component model type system
- Added builder patterns for complex types

## Documentation

- Updated architecture documentation
- Added safety guidelines
- Improved API documentation

## Build System

- Removed unnecessary BUILD files
- Standardized cargo dependency structure
