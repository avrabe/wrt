# WRT Crate Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The main `wrt` crate has been successfully refactored from a monolithic implementation into a clean integration layer that properly leverages specialized crates across the workspace.

## Refactoring Results

### Code Reduction
- **Original size**: ~10,159 lines
- **Current size**: ~4,378 lines  
- **Total reduction**: ~5,781 lines (57%)

### Files Removed
1. **stackless.rs** (1,757 lines) → Use `wrt-runtime::stackless` instead
2. **module_instance.rs** (351 lines) → Use `wrt-runtime::ModuleInstance` instead
3. **no_std_hashmap.rs** (249 lines) → Use `wrt-foundation::no_std_hashmap` instead
4. **component.rs** (1,101 lines) → Use `wrt-component` instead
5. **behavior.rs** (1,150 lines) → Use `wrt-instructions::behavior` instead
6. **validation.rs** (549 lines) → Moved to `wrt-decoder`
7. **Memory instructions from memory.rs** (~628 lines) → Use `wrt-instructions::memory_ops` instead

### Current Structure
The main `wrt` crate now contains:
- **Integration modules** (adapter pattern):
  - `cfi_integration.rs` - CFI integration layer
  - `decoder_integration.rs` - Decoder adapter
  - `instructions_adapter.rs` - Instructions adapter
  - `memory_adapter.rs` - Memory adapter
  
- **Thin wrappers** (convenience functions):
  - `memory.rs` - Memory helper functions and re-exports
  - `table.rs` - Table helper functions and re-exports
  - `global.rs` - Global helper functions and re-exports
  - `sync.rs` - Direct re-exports from wrt-sync
  
- **Core functionality**:
  - `lib.rs` - Main API surface
  - `prelude.rs` - Unified imports and re-exports
  - `execution.rs` - Execution logic (could be partially moved to wrt-runtime)
  - `interface.rs` - Component model interface
  - `serialization.rs` - State serialization
  - `resource.rs` / `resource_nostd.rs` - Resource handling
  
- **Supporting files**:
  - `stack.rs` - Stack operations
  - `stackless_extensions.rs` - Extensions for stackless engine
  - `shared_instructions.rs` - Shared instruction helpers

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated code duplication** - No more maintaining the same code in multiple places
2. **Cleaner architecture** - Each crate has a focused, single responsibility
3. **Better maintainability** - Changes only need to be made in one place
4. **Improved no_std support** - Specialized crates can be optimized for embedded use
5. **Faster compilation** - Less code to compile in the main crate
6. **Easier testing** - Functionality is properly isolated in focused crates

## Architecture Pattern

The `wrt` crate now follows the **integration layer pattern**:
- Acts as the main entry point for users
- Re-exports functionality from specialized crates
- Provides convenience functions and adapters
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Coordinates between different subsystems

## Future Improvements

Some remaining opportunities for further cleanup:
1. Move parts of `execution.rs` to `wrt-runtime`
2. Move `shared_instructions.rs` helpers to `wrt-instructions`
3. Review `interface.rs` for potential overlap with `wrt-component`
4. Ensure all no_std/no_alloc paths are properly implemented

## Summary

This refactoring transforms the WRT project from a monolithic design into a properly modularized system following Rust best practices. The main crate is now a thin integration layer that leverages specialized, focused crates for actual functionality.
